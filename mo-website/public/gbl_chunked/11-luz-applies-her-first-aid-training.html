Her First Aid Training</h1>
<p><strong>Kriegstag 3, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“Hey, King, I need your opinion on something.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“So, for my little library research trip thing with Amity, do you
think I should disguise myself as a scary-looking demon, or should I go
as a cute little innocent-looking demon?”</p>
<p>“You do realize you could just shapeshift yourself witch ears,
right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know I can do that, but I want to try and stretch my
abilities, you know? I wanna see what I’m capable of.”</p>
<p>“Well, in that case, then do the spooky demon disguise. Looking cute
and cuddly is just asking for someone to try and eat you as.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Do you think this is appropriately scary, King?” Luz then
handed the pint-sized creature a sketch she had been working on for a
while.</p>
<p>The creature Luz had drawn, which she called Kraugh, was a bipedal,
two-armed demon. Standing around 7 feet tall, it was covered in dark
green skin that was rough and scaly. The head of the creature, which Luz
had spent more time on than she wanted to admit, was very snakelike,
being flat and triangular, with a sharp beak and beady little eyes. From
each of the major joints, a long curved blade protruded. The feet and
hands of the demon both ended in three short claws that were also
curved, albeit to a lesser extent. Each hand also had an opposable
thumb, though it was sans blade. (Luz added that to the design solely so
she could pick up things without slicing them in half.) The Kraugh also
featured a large tail hanging behind the legs, tipped with even more
blades, that also doubled for stabilizing the tall demon.</p>
<p>Overall, Luz thought the design would fit right in with all the other
nightmare-inducing creatures she had seen during her time on the
Isles.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, this would go great in my army of terrors,” King said,
giving the drawing back to Luz.</p>
<p>“Do you think I should give it a test run? Make sure it looks right
and all that?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Why not?” King responded, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I like you’re thinking,” Luz said, giving a smile.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, Luz first pictured her human form. Then, she
imagined her body turning into Kraugh.</p>
<p>The first change she felt was a tail shooting out from her the bottom
of her spine. Looking behind her, Luz saw a weird fleshy material spread
down the new appendage, completely coating it. After her tail was
covered by the foreign material, a trio of spikes erupted from the
tip.</p>
<p>Before Luz could even get a chance to give the tail a practice
<em>SWISH</em> back and forth, the next stage of changes came. Her
middle and ringer fingers melded together, and she could feel something
similar happening to her toes. Her spine lengthened, rocketing her up to
nearly touching the ceiling with her head. <em>Maybe I can finally be
good at basketball now</em>, Luz joked mentally.</p>
<p>Next, Luz’s face deformed. Her nose withered away, only leaving
behind the nostrils. Her eyes that were normally wide and constantly
examining the strange new world shrunk down to mere dots. Her ears
pinned themselves flat to her head, barely visible to the naked eye. Her
lips eroded into nothing while the rest of her mouth jutted outwards and
hardened, becoming a beak. As a slight reprieve, her tongue was saved
from being mangled by the transformation. To finish off the
restructuring of her cranium, Luz’s skull tapered down and became
significantly more pointed.</p>
<p>For the final round of changes, Luz witnessed something that nearly
made her toss cookies. From her knees, elbows, and wrists, sharp-looking
curved blades made of pure bone erupted. Then, the transformation
completed by covering her entire body in scales, starting from her head
and spreading down the spine, finishing at the tip of her tail.</p>
<p>Luz was incredibly grateful that the shapeshifting process didn’t
come with any pain.</p>
<p>“So, how do I look?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely terrifying,” King answered, giving a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Sweet! Nobody’s gonna mess with me,” Luz proclaimed, imitating those
poses she saw bodybuilders do on TV.</p>
<p>“Luz, why exactly are you a giant bladed snake creature?” Eda said,
coming in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“I’m coming up with a scary demon disguise so I can go to the library
with Amity sometime over the weekend,” Luz explained.</p>
<p>“Huh, alright. You do you, kid. Look, I just checked the weather
report on the CB, and it’s gonna rain soon, so no going outside unless
you have a death-wish. Oh, and Luz?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Miss Eda?”</p>
<p>“Can you turn back into a human for me? I don’t want your claws
scratching the floor.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, Miss Eda,” Luz said, morphing back into her human
form.</p>
<p>“Hey, Luz, I wanna show you something,” King said, tugging at Luz’s
now human arm.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” King replied, letting go of her arm and scampering up
the steps all the way up to the attic, opening the door and quickly
shutting it before Luz could see what was inside.</p>
<p>Luz chuckled as she folowed along. She wondered what exactly she was
gonna see when she went in. Would it be a giant plushie fort? Or maybe
King wanted to show her his latest drawing. The diminutive demon did
occasionally refer to himself as the “King of Artists”.</p>
<p>Pushing the door open, Luz was completely thrown off by what she saw.
This was the last thing she would have expected.</p>
<p>The attic had been transformed into some kind of makeshift classroom.
A corkboard covered with a tarp sat on an easel, while a tiny school
desk was placed in front. Strung up on the walls was a diagram showing
the inner workings of Hooty. Luz was pretty sure that she could even see
a smaller, shorter Hooty inside the body of the main one, along with
rows of teeth lining the house demons insides. Luz shuddered at the
thought of there being multiple of Hooty. One was already more than
enough, but if there were even more? That would be a living
nightmare.</p>
<p>Making an educated guess, Luz crammed her way into the desk and faced
towards the tarp-covered board.</p>
<p>“So, what are we doing up here?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Basilisk Luz, you spent so much time yesterday learning about
witches and magic that you didn’t spend anytime learning about your own
kind. That is why you are here for...” King ripped the tarp off the
corkboard, revealing it to be packed with pictures of demons of all
shapes and sizes, “Demons 101!”</p>
<p>“Ooh, this sounds fun,” Luz said to herself.</p>
<p>“Demons like us are grim creatures of the night, living to spread
fear and anguish across the Isles. Our only weaknesses are purified
water and passive-aggressive remarks,” King continued.</p>
<p>“Aww, you guys have a soft side. Although, I’ve touched holy water
before, when I was baptized, and I didn’t get hurt by it.”</p>
<p>“Wait, really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Papa and I got baptized on the same day, actually.”</p>
<p>“One second.” King then pulled out a book that Luz hadn’t noticed and
began quickly scribbling in it. Crossing out the <em>All demons</em>, he
replaced it with <em>Most demons</em>. “There we go, now it’s
accurate.”</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>most</em> demons are susceptible to purified water and
passive-aggressive comments,” King said, resuming his lesson. “While you
and I are both fearsome warriors not to be trifled with, there are still
some demons we should be wary of. The most dangerous, though, is the
Snaggleback. Protected from the rains by its spiny shell, the
Snaggleback feeds on those who couldn’t find shelter. It especially
enjoys eating tourists who got trapped outside.” King flipped the pages
of his book and showed Luz a sketch of the Snaggleback.</p>
<p>“Ooh, that guy looks very spooky,” Luz said, admiring King’s fearsome
drawing of the creature.</p>
<p>Suddenly, lightning flashed in the distance and the resulting thunder
shook the house.</p>
<p>“Whelp, the rain’s here. I think we should call the lesson,” King
said, taking down the corkboard and folding up the easel, stuffing the
two in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>“I love the rain!” Luz exclaimed, running down the stairs and out the
door, but not before Eda yelled at her. “Hey, I said no going outside!
Do you want to be cooked alive?”</p>
<p>Luz obviously didn’t hear that last part. Kneeling down next to a
flower, Luz admired the plant. “I bet you’ll like the rain too, little
fella.”</p>
<p>The flower did not like the rain, apparently, getting struck by a
rogue raindrop, instantly withering and collapsing into dust.</p>
<p>“What the?” Luz cried out, scrambling away from the fallen plant.</p>
<p>“I told you to stay inside!” Eda yelled, dragging Luz back in the
house.</p>
<p>After ensuring everyone was inside, Eda let go of Luz’s arm.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get hurt, did you?” Eda asked, searching Luz for any burn
marks.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Miss Eda,” Luz said, brushing away the witch’s hand.</p>
<p>“Good. You better not pull that stunt again, cause I might not be
there to save your hide,” Eda chastised the teen, crossing her arms and
giving a stern look.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Miss Eda. It won’t happen again, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Now that everyone is inside, I’m gonna go put up the
shields.” With that, Eda went back outside to brave the storm.</p>
<p>“Do it quick! The rain is getting close to my precious stucco!” Hooty
screeched.</p>
<p>Running over to a window, Luz peeked outside to get a look at Eda
working her magic (quite literally, in this case). The witch in question
first cast a small spell, giving her a sort of magical umbrelaa,
protecting her from the rains. Eda then walked forward a few paces
before turning to face the house and casting a much larger spell. A
giant orange bubble appearead around the house before shrinking down and
conforming to the exterior. Walking back through the force field, Eda
strutted confidently back to the house.</p>
<p>“Man, that took a lot out of me. That should keep us safe until the
storm blows over, though,” the witch said, entering the house.</p>
<p>“The weather here is so fun and interesting,” Luz said with a smile
on her face.</p>
<p>“Oh you haven’t seen anything yet, kiddo. We’ve got gorenadoes, shale
hail, painbows, fun stuff like that,” Eda said, counting on her
fingers.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna regret asking this, but what’s a painbow?” Luz said
squeamishly.</p>
<p>“It’s like a Human Realm rainbow, except looking at it turns your
body inside out!” King answered with a giggle.</p>
<p>Luz regretted asking.</p>
<p>She did <em>not</em> need that mental image.</p>
<p>“So, do we have any plans to wait out the storm, Miss Eda?” Luz
asked.</p>
<p>“Not really. We can do whatever, pretty much,” Eda responded.</p>
<p>“Hmm... Can we do some magic lessons? Mr. Bump at Hexside said that
you could probably teach me.”</p>
<p>Eda let out a groan. “Of course Bumpykins would put that idea in your
head. Alright, kid, we’ll do one lesson, okay? That’s it.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Luz said, nodding.</p>
<p>“You said you learned about bile sacs and stufff while posing as that
kid’s homework, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Learned about ‘em in all their gory glory.”</p>
<p>“Well then, that will make this easier. Alright, let’s start with an
example. This is a light spell.” Eda then drew a large circle in the
air, which condensed into a ball of pure light upon completion. “The
larger you draw the circle, the more powerful the spell, and the more
magic it’ll take to complete the spell.” To emphasize this, Eda then
drew a much smaller circle, with the resulting tiny light ball
flickering out of existence after a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Woah. That is so cool. Can you do that again? I wanna record it this
time,” Luz said, reaching into her pocket and opening the
<em>Camera</em> app on her phone.</p>
<p>“Sure, kid. So ya see, the spell works by–” Eda suddenly collapsed to
the ground unconscious, not even getting a chance to finish the spell
circle.</p>
<p>“Oh no, Miss Eda!” Eda ran over to her fallen teacher and quickly
checked the witch’s pulse. It was still there, though it was going way
faster than what Luz considered normal.</p>
<p>Thankful for Mamá giving her some first aid training, Luz dragged
Eda’s body (which was way heavier than Luz expected) over to the couch
and situated the unconcious witch so that her legs were elevated about a
foot above her head. Checking for anything that could be constricting
blood flow, Luz luckily found nothing.</p>
<p>“Alright, hopefully that helps,” Luz said, taking a step back. “Now,
we just have to wait for her to wake up. I’m so sorry this happened,
Miss Eda,” Luz apologized.</p>
<p>“Has this ever happened before, King?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Never,” he responded.</p>
<p>“Okay, so that probably means that Miss Eda is running low on magic.
She did say that putting up the force fields took a lot out of her,
after all. Is there any, like, magic drink we can give her?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but I’ve noticed that Eda always drinks this one
orange elixir every day that seems to give her a boost of energy in the
morning. Maybe we should give her some of that?”</p>
<p>“Hmm... That could work. Do you know where Eda keeps them?”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure she stores ‘em in her room.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go find some, then.”</p>
<p>After one last look at the Owl Lady, Luz ran up the stairs and made
her way into Eda’s room. King followed behind quickly, shutting the door
and turning on the light.</p>
<p>“Alright, where could it– Oh, there it is.” Luz’s eyes scanned the
room before quickly falling on the bright orange elixir laying on Eda’s
nestside table. (Luz thought it was a little odd to have a nest instead
of a traditional bed, but Eda was odd herself, so Luz just wrote it off
as Eda being Eda.)</p>
<p>A flash of lightning and a crash of thunder shook the house.</p>
<p>Grabbing the elixir, Luz examined it, seeing if there were any
instructions printed on the glass. There was nothing.</p>
<p>“Okay, magic in a bottle secured, now let’s–” Luz was cut off by the
lights suddenly going dark.</p>
<p>King ran over and gave the light switch a few flicks up and down,
only for nothing to happen.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Hooty controls the house lights. He probably just fell
asleep or something,” the tiny demon said.</p>
<p>“HOOT! OW! HOOT!” the house demon screamed.</p>
<p>“That does <em>not</em> sound like he’s asleep,” Luz said, dropping
the elixir and running down the stairs. In the back of her mind, Luz
heard the sound of shattering glass.</p>
<p>Upon entering the living room, Luz saw that the front door had been
knocked off its hinges and was laying on the floor. A creature stood in
the doorway, dragging a pair of claws along the door, leaving deep
gouges in the wood. Suddenly, there was another flash of lightning, and
by the time Luz could see again, the creature was gone.</p>
