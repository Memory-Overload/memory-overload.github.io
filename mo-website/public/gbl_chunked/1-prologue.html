<p><strong>Second Lunar Disappearance, 12 CE | Somewhere on the
outskirts of the Left Hand</strong></p>
<p>Tonight, it was Jara's turn to keep watch as the others slept.</p>
<p>They had gotten lucky the past few days, but Jara knew better than to
put his faith in luck. Something was bound to go wrong. That was how the
universe worked. It would lull you into relaxing before driving a dagger
through your chest. That was how they had lost Toby. They had been
foolish to blindly accept the help of a guard. That would never happen
again.</p>
<p>Shaking his head to clear out the depressing thoughts, Jara turned
from his post outside the makeshift tent and looked in on his sleeping
wife and child. Ket looked as beautiful as ever. When the moonlight
caught her aquamarine scales just right, they would give off the
prettiest shine. She slept peacefully, arm draped over Manil in a soft,
but firm, grasp. Manil was the cutest little basilisk one could ever
see, with his light brown scales and a cute little nose with that small
white birthmark on it that looked like a smile. Likewise, a small smile
crept onto Jara's face. He enjoyed these moments, fleeting as they were,
where a family and their newborn could simply relax, not having to worry
about when their next meal would be, or how much longer they'll have to
run from the Emperor's Coven.</p>
<p>After giving his wife a quick kiss on the forehead, Jara returned to
his lookout duty. The night was uneventful so far. A few rogue fairies
had given him a small reprieve from the monotonous nothingness of the
surrounding woods, but other than that the area was free of any other
signs of life. He felt himself begin to succumb to sleep when he heard a
noise off in the distance. It sounded like feet, making their way
through the woods. Jara estimated there to be about five people in the
approaching party based off the cadence of the footsteps. Suddenly, a
shout broke through the rustling of leaves.</p>
<p>"We know where you are, demons! Just give yourselves over, and we'll
make your deaths less painful."</p>
<p>Quickly, Jara opened the tent flap and shook Ket. His wife was scared
by the sudden awakening, shooting upright.</p>
<p>"Ahh! What in the name of the Titan are you doing?"</p>
<p>"We have to leave. Hunters are close by and could show up at any
minute. We need to go now! You get Manil and run, I'll fight off the
hunters."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you can handle them?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Now go!"</p>
<p>Jara was lying. He knew this fight would end in his death. He knew
that, and he accepted that. As long as his family was safe, that was all
that mattered. Jara quickly began shifting forms, going from species to
species as fast as possible. He depleted his reserves as much as he
could without leaving himself sluggish. A hungry basilisk is a dangerous
basilisk, after all.</p>
<p>Jara made his way out the front of the tent and waited. He looked
around the area. Nothing was happening. Not a single butterknifefly,
griffin, or demon hunter in sight.</p>
<p>"Hey! I'm right here! Come fight me face to face!"</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>Deciding to go on the offensive, Jara began walking around the
perimeter, making as much noise as he could.</p>
<p>"Come on! What are you, scared?"</p>
<p>A fireball flew past his face, narrowly missing.</p>
<p>"There we go! How hard was that?"</p>
<p>Jara laughed. He turned to face whoever had thrown that. He didn't
know how long he was going to fight, but he did know that he was going
to be dining in FÃ³lkvangr by sunrise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ket took off running out the back of the tent. One hand
was carrying her child while the other was shifted into a sword,
knocking away obstacles. The forests of the Left Hand were notorious for
their hard to traverse terrain, and this patch was no exception. Tree
branches swatted at her face, vines tangled her feet, and fairies
screamed of their lust for skin, but she kept running.</p>
<p>Eventually, she grew tired. Her body was giving up on her. Her legs
were burning, and her breathing was labored. She needed to find a place
to slow down and catch her breath. Leaning her back against a nearby
tree, she took those deep breaths like she had practiced. In-2-3-4,
Out-2-3-4, In-2-3-4, Out-2-3-4. That was better. Manil had also calmed
down as well, nestling into the crook of her elbow and taking a nap. As
she slowly looked around and took in the surrounding scenery, she
noticed a lake that miraculously wasn't boiling. Ever the opportunist,
Ket made her way over to the body of water and gave it a closer look.
She had to make sure there weren't any creatures lurking under the
surface before she could risk taking a drink.</p>
<p>As she scrutinized the lake further, she noticed that it had an
odd-looking shine to it, like it wasn't water that was lapping at the
edges of the sand, but something else entirely. It was an odd color as
well, being a navy blue instead of the normal gray and red hues found in
other bodies of water on the Isles. Suddenly, a long-forgotten memory
arose. Ket had heard stories about lakes like this. Her grandfather had
told her that these spots were where the blood of the Titan and water
had mixed together, ripping a hole in the fabric of reality and creating
a portal between the realms.</p>
<p>Deciding to test her theory, she squatted down and dipped her finger
into the lake. As her finger initially broke the surface, the lake felt
warm and welcoming, but it eventually gave way to a cool and dry
sensation, and she felt a light wind blowing just below the surface. Ket
retracted her finger and stood up.</p>
<p>Ket then did what any sane demon would do in her situation: She
closed her eyes, tucked Manil close to her chest, and dove into the
lake.</p>
<p><strong>July 16, 1983 | Outside the city limits of Neustadt,
Pennsylvania</strong></p>
<p>Ket slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked down and saw Manil, still asleep and dreaming peacefully.
Looking back up, she saw buildings on the horizon. However, she had
never seen buildings that looked like these ones before.</p>
<p>Ket smiled.</p>
<p>They were free.</p>
