  <strong>Schlaftag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl House</strong>
</p>

<p>Hooty was a good house demon, and as a good house demon, he was responsible with making sure that everyone who lived in his walls was kept safe, which also meant he had to know how everyone was doing at all times. So when he felt someone suddenly fall to the ground, he knew something was amiss.</p>

<p>Rocketing over to Luz's unconscious body, he wrapped the basilisk up and shot back to the house. He carefully maneuvered her body through the front door before depositing her on the couch, laying her down gently to make sure he didn't startle her awake.</p>

<p>Eda and King walked in from the kitchen, where they had just put the bat babies down for a nap.</p>

<p>"Hooty, what are you - Wait, Luz?!" Eda was confused by the bird worm's actions before she realized who he had just brought in. Eda was now very glad that the babies were asleep.</p>

<p>"What happened?" King asked.</p>

<p>"She was walking over here, but then her body said it wanted to take a nap!" Hooty replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>Eda groaned before dragging her hand down her face.</p>

<p>"Hooty, do me a favor and leave," she said.</p>

<p>"Okay!" the house demon said, complying to the order and shutting the front door.</p>

<p>Eda then knelt down in front of Luz's unconscious body and waved a hand in front of the girl's face.</p>

<p>No reaction.</p>

<p>Eda snapped her fingers a few time.</p>

<p>Still nothing.</p>

<p>"Hello, Isles to Luz. Anybody in there?"</p>

<p>No luck.</p>

<p>King poked her side with one of his claws.</p>

<p>Eda gently shook Luz's shoulders. "Come on, kid. Wake up. Please."</p>

<p>The witch shook harder. "Dang it, Luz. What's gotten into you?"</p>

<p>Luz showed no signs of feeling any of what just happened.</p>

<p>Owlbert emerged from his witch's hair. Her distress was obvious. He hopped onto Eda's shoulder before fluttering down to rest on Luz's chest. The palisman trilled softly and rubbed his head against Luz's neck. This finally drew a reaction from the basilisk, as she sniffed at the air and then began drooling ever so slightly. She then moved to roll over, except this action sent her careening off the edge of the couch.</p>

<p>"Oh no you don't!" Eda said, scooping up her apprentice before she could face-plant on the hard wooden floor.</p>

<p>That is what finally got Luz to wake up.</p>

<p>"Huh? Wah? Wuzgoinon?" the girl slurred out, not quite sure what was happening and how she had ended up back at the house.</p>

<p>Eda set Luz down on her feet before wrapping her up in a hug. "Oh thank Titan, never do that to us again."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Eda was super scared! Not me, though. I knew you'd wake up," King boasted. Nonetheless, he joined the hug, wrapping his arms around Luz's legs.</p>

<p>"What, what happened? I remember walking back from the library and I was feeling hungry, but not much after that," Luz scratched at the back of her neck. It felt itchy for some reason.</p>

<p>"Well, Hooty said that you were just about to make it here when you collapsed. He wrapped you up and then dropped you off on the couch. We tried to wake you up, but nothing worked, and then Owlbert nuzzled you and ya nearly ate floor," Eda explained.</p>

<p>Luz scratched at her arm. She also noticed that her vision was a little blurry, which was odd.</p>

<p>"You sure your alright, kid?" Eda questioned, eying the girl suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes, Eda, I'm fine. I'm just a little hungry, that's all." Luz used her right foot to scratch her left calf.</p>

<p>"Really? Then when's the last time you ate?" Eda crossed her arms.</p>

<p>"Today at lunch. We had those tasty burgers, remember?" the basilisk answered, rubbing her thumb across the back of her other hand.</p>

<p>"I know that kid, I was there. I'm talking about <em>magic</em>. When's the last time you had any magic?" Eda asked pointedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that..." Luz realized. She thought about it for a moment before responding, "I think the last time was when I drained Principal Bump." She said the last part slowly, still ashamed about the incident.</p>

<p>"And how long ago was that?" Eda raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"About three weeks ago?" Luz replied sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Kid?" Eda said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Eda?" Luz knew where this was going.</p>

<p>"Are you telling me that you haven't had any magic in <em>three weeks</em>?" Eda couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>"Yes," Luz replied quietly, looking down at the floor.</p>

<p>Eda facepalmed, and then took a deep breath before slowly releasing it. "Dang it, Luz. You are a basilisk, and basilisks eat magic. Did you think you could just not eat magic and everything would be all hunky-dory?"</p>

<p>"Kinda," Luz said, still in a staring contest with a hole in the floorboard.</p>

<p>Eda sighed. "Hey, kiddo, look up here." Luz slowly raised her head to make eye contact with the witch.</p>

<p>The Owl Lady grabbed her apprentice's shoulders. "As long as you're living under this roof, within these four walls, I'm gonna make sure that you're well fed, okay? No matter what you want or need, I'll get it for you, even if it's the most illegal or dangerous thing ever. I'm not having you starving when I can do anything about it, <em>capisce</em>?"</p>

<p>Luz simply nodded, and Eda pulled the girl back into another hug.</p>

<p>"You don't have to worry, kiddo," Eda said.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Luz responded.</p>

<p>As the two disengaged the hug, Eda cleared her throat. "Alright, mushy feelings time is over.  Okay kid, open up."</p>

<p>The Owl Lady spun up a spell circle, but stopped just before the magic was cast.</p>

<p>"Wait, what? No way. I'm not going to drain you of your magic! That's insane!" Luz argued.</p>

<p>Eda cancelled the spell. "Look, kid. You need some magic in your system real bad, and I've got plenty to offer."</p>

<p>"But what if I go overboard? What if I can't control myself?" Luz replied.</p>

<p>"I'll be fine. Besides, if you do try and take too much, King or Hooty can just distract you so you stop," Eda replied calmly.</p>

<p>"But-" Luz began.</p>

<p>"No buts," Eda interrupted. "Now come on, I'm getting hungry as well, and we could all use some dinner." With that, Eda cast another spell circle, forming a large ball of light that floated its way in front of Luz.</p>

<p>"Fine," Luz said begrudgingly. She opened her mouth and sucked in the light, feeling her stomach fill up. Luz instantly felt way better than before now that she actually had magic in her. As the basilisk drained the ball of light, Eda showed no signs of even noticing that her magic had been slightly depleted, standing with arms crossed and a smile on her face.</p>

<p>"Feeling better now, kid?" Eda asked.</p>

<p>"Totally!" Luz replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Good, now let's get some dinner," Eda said, bending down to ruffle Luz's hair. As she did, though, she noticed that the girl's eyes looked weird, almost like they had been clouded over.</p>

<p>"Is your vision good, kid? Your eyes look a little... hazy," Eda noted.</p>

<p>"It's fine," Luz said, brushing it off. "Probably just allergies or something. No need to worry."</p>

<p>"Alright, but if it sticks around, let me know, alright?" Eda said.</p>

<p>"Got it." Luz gave a thumbs up.</p>

<p>"Good. So what do you two want-" Eda began to say before she was cut off by a knock at the door.</p>

<p>Luz went to open the door, careful to make sure she was in witch ear mode. She grabbed the handle and pulled to reveal a ginormous pale face filling her vision.</p>

<p>"Holy mother of-" Luz jumped backwards at the surprise. The giant face forced itself through the doorway and into the living room. Before Luz stood a giant head with bat wings and long black hair draped down the back, though a rebellious forelock dangled in front.</p>

<p>Then Luz made the connection. "Woah, you must be Yi Yi."</p>

<p>The giant head nodded. "Yes. Yi Yi is I, and I is the Bat Queen. You have babies, yes?"</p>

<p>"Yup. They're taking a nap right now," Luz affirmed.</p>

<p>"Good, good." Yi Yi said, before letting out a sharp whistle. From the other room, the babies awoke, and they quickly flew back to their mom. They all nuzzled against Yi Yi before disappearing into her hair.</p>

<p>The Bat Queen vomited out a chest and spat out a whistle. "Reward, for keep babies safe. Many thanks. Whistle is for troubles. You are all owed one." Eda opened the chest to see it replete with snails. Luz swore she could see money signs in Eda's eyes.</p>

<p>Yi Yi then turned to force her way through the door, but stopped and sniffed the air. She turned to Luz and sniffed again. The Bat Queen put her face right up against Luz and inhaled one more time to confirm her suspicions.</p>

<p>"You not witch," Yi Yi stated.</p>

<p>"What? That's bologna! I'm totally a witch! Look, I've even got witch ears! Tell her I'm a witch, Eda," Luz tried to plead. It was at times like this she wished she wasn't a horrible liar.</p>

<p>"She's not a witch, BQ," Eda said, betraying Luz.</p>

<p>"I thought. You smell like basilisk. Unique smell," Yi Yi said.</p>

<p>Something wasn't adding up for Luz. "Wait, how do you know what basilisk smells like?"</p>

<p>The Bat Queen laughed. "Live with me. Wash smell off very hard."</p>

<p>Luz's eyes widened as she realized what Yi Yi had just said. "Wait, are you telling me that there are other basilisks, and they are <em>living with you</em>?"</p>

<p>Yi Yi just nodded. "I protect all lost. They lost, I find, I keep safe."</p>

<p>Luz was floored. She had always had that inkling in the back of her mind that hoped that she wasn't the last of her kind, but to have it <em>confirmed</em>. She was at a loss for words.</p>

<p>The Bat Queen noticed the girl's silence. "You like meet them?" she offered.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Luz answered, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Good. Tomorrow, come to den. You meet Tre, Ivy." With that final note, the Bat Queen squeezed through the front door and flew away from the Owl House.</p>

<p>Luz ran out the door to thank Yi Yi, but by the time she was outside, the Bat Queen had vanished into the night.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" Luz shouted to nobody.</p>

<p>She slowly went back inside, finding Eda and King back on the couch, playing with all the snails that Yi Yi had rewarded them with.</p>

<p>"So, kid, you ready to dine like royalty?" Eda tossed a handful of snails Luz's way.</p>

<p>"Please," Luz begged. "I am <em>starving</em>!"</p><hr />

</p>

<p>Luz slowly awoke to the sound of her alarm screaming. She fumbled around for a few seconds before bopping it on the head to make it shut up.</p>

<p>Today was the big day. She was finally going to meet other basilisks!</p>

<p>Just as Luz was about to shift into her cat hoodie, she paused. If she was going to be meeting other basilisks, it would probably be best if she was in her basilisk form when she met them. She hadn't been in that form for a while, mainly sticking in either human mode or witch-ears mode.</p>

<p>Luz pictured her basilisk form and quickly morphed. Now that she actually had magic in her stomach, it didn't hurt to shapeshift! Though, she did feel a little bit weird for some reason. She couldn't quite describe it.</p>

<p>Back in her "natural" state, Luz slithered out her bedroom door and across the hall to the bathroom. It was a tad bit harder to grab her toothbrush, mainly on account of her suddenly having a different hand structure. If she wanted to make a good first impression, though, then having minty fresh breath was a good start.</p>

<p>Exiting the bathroom, Luz turned to head down to the kitchen when she realized she had forgotten about something: stairs. In this form, she had no idea how to get downstairs in a way that didn't devolve into her body-slamming each stair as she dropped down each one. After not being able to come up with a way to go downstairs without hurting her stomach, Luz resolved to just morph human, walk down the stairs like a normal person, and then morph back into basilisk.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, Luz grabbed an apple to serve as an early-morning snack. Slithering into the living room, she found King curled up on one of the chests, soaking in the rays of the sun. Looking around, Eda was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Luz gently shook King awake. The bone creature yawned before looking to see who disturbed his beauty sleep.</p>

<p>"Whadya want?" he said in between yawns.</p>

<p>"Do you know where Eda is?" Luz asked.</p>

<p>King let out another long yawn before responding, "Off in the forest. Getting plants or something, I dunno. 'm tired." He moved to curl back up, scooching to the right to follow the sun.</p>

<p>Eda kicked the front door open, a large burlap slack hanging over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, speak of the devil. Hi, Eda," Luz greeted the witch with a wave.</p>

<p>"Hey, kid. Have you had breakfast yet?" the Owl Lady inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, uh, not really. Just an apple," Luz supplied, holding up the half-eaten fruit.</p>

<p>"Good. Try this." Eda reached into the sack and withdrew a small black object, which she then tossed to Luz.</p>

<p>Luz grabbed the projectile and examined it, turning it over in her hand. "What exactly is this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That, dear child, is a bloodberry. It's a cousin to the goreberry, and it's reported to grow only where the Titan's magic is particularly strong," Eda explained, before adding on, "Found that bad boy near a weird lake. Go on, give it a taste!"</p>

<p>Luz cautiously bit into the berry, only to find a pleasant sweet taste. She quickly swallowed it. "Woah, that was actually pretty good!"</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," Eda said. "I've got a boatload of 'em in here. Well, that and some more normal fruits and veggies" She motioned with the bag.</p>

<p>"Nice. Thanks, Eda!" Luz replied.</p>

<p>"Eh, don't worry about it, kiddo. I said I'd keep you fed, and I don't intend to go back on my word."</p>

<p>Eda collapsed into the couch, splaying her arms and legs out as she got comfortable.</p>

<p>"So, kid, you ready to meet other basilisks?"</p>

<p>"Yup! I can't wait!"</p>

<p>"That's what I like to hear."</p>
