<html><head><title>The Life of the (Costume) Party</title></head><body><p>"Alright, I'm coming down!" Masha called out from the bathroom. Vee turned around on the couch to see her partner walking down the stairs, dressed in their costume for the evening. In Masha's continued efforts to "blow up gender norms" (their exact words), they had settled on going to the party as a Bug Facer from the Nemo Ramjet mythos. To the basilisk, it was the most "Masha" costume that they could've picked out, and they looked absolutely incredible with it on. Well, they always looked incredible, but that was beside the point.</p>

<p>The couple had spent way longer than they thought they would when designing the costume to be a nearly perfect replica of the canon Bug Facer design. Given, there had to be some alterations to make it more feasible, like squishing the face vertically and spreading it horizontally so that the design could fit on Masha's round and very much <em> not </em> pyramid-shaped face. Even in spite of the alterations that had to be made, the face paint design still came out great. When the enby pursed their lips, it looked like they sported a pair of mandibles in lieu of a mouth. A pair of eyes had also been added just above their eyebrows, and if they closed their real eyes then the design looked even more accurate to the actual alien.</p>

<p>To complete the costume, Masha had assembled an outfit consisting of a white dress shirt (with the sleeves rolled up, of course) that had been intentionally dirtied up, a knee-length black pleated skirt, black leggings, and their lucky gray sneakers. It was a unique clothing combo, to say the least.</p>

<p>"So, what do you think? Is it spooky enough?" Masha asked, giving Vee a twirl so that she could see the costume from all angles.</p>

<p>"It looks great!" Vee replied. "I bet they'd give you first place if you entered it in a contest."</p>

<p>Masha brushed off the complement with a hand wave. "Oh quit buttering me up. I bet you'd probably win over this old thing. Speaking of, where is your costume?"</p>

<p>In response, Vee shifted into her true form. "<em>This</em> is my costume."</p>

<p>"You're going as... you?" Masha cocked an eyebrow. They were a little confused about the decision for their girlfriend to go out in public in her true form. It would be risky, especially if they ran into Jacob again.</p>

<p>"It's not like anyone's gonna suspect anything," Vee said. "Think about it. If you didn't know any better, you'd probably assume I'm just wearing a really elaborate costume and not that I'm a demon from another dimension."</p>

<p>"You have a point," Masha conceded.</p>

<p>"I always do," Vee responded with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, either way, you don't want to push your luck." Masha didn't want Vee to have to deal with a mini-Jacob running around just because she accidentally did something too demon-like and spooked a human.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll keep the scary demon-ness to a minimum," Vee said as she began slithering over to the front door.</p>

<p>"Ready to head out?" Masha asked, joining their partner at the door.</p>

<p>"You know it," Vee replied, reaching her hand out and intertwining it with Masha's.</p>

<p>Stepping through the front door and into the great unknown, the two began their long and arduous trek across the street and down a few houses.</p><hr />

<p>As far as Debbie was concerned, the costume party was already a massive success, even if it was barely an hour old yet. Moving to grab another refill of her drink (The bowl claimed it was a "Mysterious Potion", but the taste of fruit punch was unmistakable.), the chime of the doorbell drew her attention. Setting her cup down, she hustled over to welcome in the newest round of party-goers.</p>

<p>Opening the door revealed two people, one of whom was obviously Masha Pitt, but the other Debbie could only hazard a guess. Masha had a very interesting costume on, to say the least, and the design of their facepaint reminded Debbie of some kind of bug or insect. The other person was harder to recognize, though, as they were wearing a full-body costume that covered every identifiable feature. </p>

<p>The costume was nothing to scoff at, not by a long shot. The design was of a slug or snail missing its shell, though instead of smooth, fleshy skin, the costume had row upon row of scales. Based on the way that the light was reflecting off each scale meant that they weren't just a fabric pattern, but either the real deal or a very convincing replica. The level of detail didn't stop there, though, as she could see that the tail dragging behind the costume was apparently rigged to move from side to side, which was honestly mind blowing since this looked to be homemade.</p>

<p>Shaking her head to refocus on welcoming in her guests, Debbie stepped aside and swept her arm, motioning for the visitors to come in. "Hey, hey, hey, come on and join the party."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the invite, Deb," Masha said as they entered the house.</p>

<p>"Eh, I'm glad you could come. Who's your plus one there?" Debbie asked. "It can't be one of your C7 buddies since Ax and Marco are already here and Luz has gone MIA."</p>

<p>"I'm Vee, Luz's sister," the person in the slug(?) costume said, offering out a handshake.</p>

<p>"Nice to meet ya, Vee," Debbie reciprocated the handshake, and it turns out that those really were scales that she was looking at. <em> How long did it take her to put this together? </em> she thought. "So, yeah, make yourselves comfortable. We've got snacks, drinks, and we're gonna play some <em> spooooky </em> tunes on the record player."</p>

<p>"Sounds dope," Masha replied. "You said Ax and Marco are already here, so where are those two doofuses?"</p>

<p>"They were hanging out in the kitchen last I saw," Debbie answered, jerking her thumb over her shoulder, pointing in the direction of the room.</p>

<p>Masha chuckled. "Of course they're in the kitchen. Come on, Vee, let's stop them from eating all the snacks before we can get to them."</p><hr />

<p>All things considered, this party was going well for Marco. Heck, he'd even managed to get a cute guy's number, and that would probably be the highlight of his night. Removing the headpiece of his gorilla costume, the Latino relished in the air conditioning. While the Big Jim costume was epic, it got insanely hot under all the fake fur and rubber. Suddenly, the doorbell chimed, signifying that more people had finally shown up.</p>

<p>Taking a sip from his soda, Marco's eyes flitted over to the entryway to see who was joining the fun. Oh sweet, Masha and Vee were here. Masha had that Insect Facer costume or whatever, and they were rocking it with the dirty dress shirt and skirt. Vee, on the other hand, was in her basilisk form. Wait... Vee was in her basilisk form. In public.</p>

<p>Nudging Ax to get their attention, Marco nodded his head in Vee's direction. Ax's eyes grew wide in surprise when they realized that Vee had decided to go to the party <em> au natural </em>. After Masha had finished introducing Vee and Debbie, the two walked over to join Ax and Marco in the kitchen. (Well, Vee slithered given that she didn't have legs, but that was beside the point.)</p>

<p>"Sup," Vee began, nonchalantly sidling up to Marco and fishing her own soda out from the fridge.</p>

<p>"Vee?" Marco said as the basilisk popped the tab of her can open and took a drink.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" she responded, lowering her soda.</p>

<p>"Why are you... y'know... you right now?" <em> Great job, Cabrera. She'll </em> totally <em> get that </em>, Marco chided himself mentally.</p>

<p>"It's a costume party, which means people will just assume this is a costume," Vee explained.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's gonna work?" Ax asked, looking around at the mass of people that had congregated in the living room. There was no way that everybody here would buy that excuse.</p>

<p>"YO, THAT'S A DOPE SNAKE COSTUME!" A random person shouted over the music.</p>

<p>"THANKS!" Vee shouted back. "See, it works," she added smugly.</p>

<p>"I stand corrected," Ax admitted before taking a slow sip from their drink.</p><hr />

<p>As Vee and Masha slowly walked down the driveway and started heading back to the Noceda house, the enby slung their arm over Vee's shoulder.</p>

<p>"So, what did you think?" Masha asked the basilisk. Based on the basilisk's giddy smile and how her tail was wagging a mile a minute, they could make a confident guess how it went for her. Every time someone complimented Vee's "costume" she had this giant smile on her face as she thanked them, and when someone would eventually ask where they could get their own "giant slug costume", she would reply that she made it herself with a smug grin and a laugh.</p>

<p>"It was awesome! I can't wait for next year's costume party!"</p></body></html>
