<html><head><title>Who Can It Be Now?</title></head><body><p>Jacob Hopkins was not a fan of visitors. Whenever someone came knocking at his door, it would almost always be to make fun of him and his theories or play some cruel prank. So, when he heard someone rap at his door, he ignored it, hoping for them to go away if he just waited it out. But then they knocked again. And again. And again. Letting out a grunt at the persistent knocking, Jacob got up from his desk and squeezed through the mountains of proof concerning aliens and/or demons from Mars that wanted to steal everyone's teeth. Yanking open the front door of his apartment, Jacob was now face to face with one Masha Pitt.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked, propping an arm on the doorway so they couldn't barge in.</p>

<p>"I want to talk," they responded matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"No, duh," Jacob said. That part was obvious. Why else would they be here? "Talk about what? I'm a busy man."</p>

<p>"I have some... information that you might be interested in." The goth reached into their pocket and pulled out a flash drive with the letter V written on it.</p>

<p>In response, Jacob unblocked the doorway and motioned for Masha to come in. The conspiracy theorist was in shock. Did someone else actually believe him? If so, this was a miracle! Though Jacob tried to shut the door after them so that none of those damn glowies could spy on his conversation with another believer, Masha kept the door the slightest bit open by catching it on the heel of their shoe.</p>

<p>Realizing that his apartment looked like a pigsty, Jacob began quickly cleaning up after himself. Grabbing the plates off the coffee table, he dumped them in the sink before moving a box of evidence off the couch so that his guest could make themselves comfortable if they so pleased. "Sorry for the mess. I don't usually get visitors."</p>

<p>The enby brushed the statement off with a small laugh. "That's fine. You should see my room. It makes this place look like a palace. Though, for the reason I'm here: I heard through the grapevine that you're a man after the truth about demons and such. Is that right?"</p>

<p>Jacob puffed up his chest. "Of course. I'm the most learned man in the county when it comes to true demonology and xenology. So, what is it you wanted to know?"</p>

<p>Masha shrugged and pulled out the flash drive once again. "Well, I was inspired by what you wrote about the skin stealing demon that is impersonating the Noceda kid, so I did my own surveillance on the family. This contains everything I've captured, and I wanted to get your expert opinion."</p>

<p>Jacob smiled. Ahh, someone else knew how Miss Noceda was in constant danger because of her housing a demon. "I'll give it a look. Do you mind?" He held out his hand, seeing if Masha was willing to part ways with their evidence temporarily. The enby quickly dropped the drive in Jacob's waiting hand, not wanting to actually come in contact with the person who had a vendetta against their <em>Schatz</em>.</p>

<p>While Jacob walked over to his desk and took a seat, Masha followed behind, stealing a glance over their shoulder before taking their spot behind the conspiracy theorist. Jacob tried to plug the flash drive into an open USB slot on his PC tower, but the drive refused to slot in. Flipping it over, he tried again, only to fail once more. Again, he flipped it over, and the third time was the charm, the drive clicking into place. Shaking his mouse to wake up the computer, he typed in his incredibly secure password ("p@$$w0rd", for those wondering.) and opened up the file manager. After a second of loading, the USB drive was recognized by the system, popping up on the GUI under the name "Stuff". Double-clicking on the drive icon, the window showed the contents of the flash drive, which was just two folders: "Noceda Family (TOP SECRET)" and "Cute Slug Photos". Masha blushed at the second one, pointing to the other folder on screen. "That's the one you want."</p>

<p>"Alright, let's see what we're working with," Jacob replied, clicking into the folder. He was met with row upon row of pictures, though the file names didn't offer much info, most being along the line of "nocedaFam1.png", "nocedaFam2.png", etc.</p>

<p>Opening the first photo, the screen displayed a shot of the Noceda household's front door. Pressing the right arrow key to go to the next picture, the shot moved a little closer to the door. Spamming the right arrow a few times, the photos showed Masha reaching out and knocking on the door, which was subsequently opened by that demon impersonating Luz Noceda in all its snake-like glory.</p>

<p>Jacob smiled. The demon didn't know it was exposing its existence to the whole world. The demon then led Masha into the kitchen before pulling out a small stack of paper. The conspiracy theorist frowned. What was going on? Paging over to the next picture, the paper on top of the stack was shown, one large word filling the screen.</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    <em>LOOK</em>
  </strong>
</p>

<p>He pressed the right arrow.</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    <em>BEHIND</em>
  </strong>
</p>

<p>Another right arrow, another new word.</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    <em>YOU</em>
  </strong>
</p>

<p>Slowly turning around in his chair, Jacob Hopkins was suddenly looking up at the demon from the pictures. Letting out a very manly scream, Jacob scrambled out of his seat and tried to <strike>run away</strike> make a tactical retreat, but the demon copied his movements, blocking his escape path.</p>

<p>"Boo!" the demon shouted, her mouth filled with too many teeth, all of which were far too sharp. In response, Jacob reached behind him, scrounging around his desk, eventually grabbing a snow globe of Area 51 and brandishing his weapon.</p>

<p>"Don't even think of stealing my teeth!" Jacob screamed, waving the snow globe back and forth.</p>

<p>The demon laughed. "Man, you're so fun to mess with. Mash was right. You are a sad little man."</p>

<p>Then, the skin stealer got uncomfortably close to Jacob and whispered in his ear. "Stay away from my family." Jacob nodded quickly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the power went out, casting the apartment in darkness. As the lights slowly turned back on, Jacob found himself alone again. Taking a few shallow breaths, he realized he needed a change of pants.</p></body></html>
