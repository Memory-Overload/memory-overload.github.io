<p>"Alright, guys. Mami and I are gonna head over to ShopRite to pick up some groceries. While we're gone, Vee's in charge, so listen to whatever she says. The only rule that Mama has set is that none of you are to go outside without proper ear coverings or illusions. But besides that, feel free to go wild. Watch TV, read a book, whatever you want. Just don't burn down the house or do anything that'll get you arrested. That sound good?"</p>

<p>A chorus of "Yes" rang out from the couch and armchairs.</p>

<p>"Cool."</p>

<p>From outside, Camila honked the car horn twice.</p>

<p>"Alright gotta go. Bye, guys!"</p>

<p>As the car pulled out of the driveway, the living room was dead quiet, nobody willing to speak up.</p>

<p>Gus was the first to break the silence. "So... what should we do? We've probably got an hour or two until they get back."</p>

<p>"We could watch another documentary about wolves," Hunter suggested.</p>

<p>"Hunter, we've already watched 5 in the past 3 days. Don't you want to watch something else?" Amity replied, shooting down the idea.</p>

<p>"No. Wolves are incredible creatures and you're just a hater who can't see how cool they are," Hunter shot back.</p>

<p>"Okay, so no wolf documentaries," Vee jumped in, stifling the argument before it turned into another brawl. "How about we do something <em>besides</em> watch the TV."</p>

<p>"That's a great idea, Vee!" Willow said, seconding the suggestion. "Maybe we could try out that 'Internet' thing Luz always talks about."</p>

<p>"Yeah, let's do it!" Gus said.</p><hr />

<p>Vee could barely suppress her giggles as she watched the gang's feeble attempts at unlocking Camila's desktop computer.</p>

<p>The screen had been stuck on <em>Enter your password:</em> for the past 10 minutes.</p>

<p>"Okay, so we've already tried 'Luz', 'PleaseOpen', and 'WolvesRCool'. What else could it be?" Amity rubbed at her forehead, wracking her brain to try and figure out the magic phrase that would let them access the computer.</p>

<p>"How about we try-" Hunter began to say.</p>

<p>"I swear to Titan, if the next words out of your mouth have anything to do with wolves, I will slap you," Amity snapped.</p>

<p>Hunter snorted. "I was going to suggest 'CosmicFrontier', thank you very much."</p>

<p>"Fine, we'll try it," Amity begrudgingly replied. She slowly pecked at the keyboard, not at all used to the weird layout. Finally pressing the <em>Enter</em> button, the group waited with bated breath to see if they could finally get past the logon screen.</p>

<p>For the first time in what felt like forever, the computer finally showed something different. <em>Welcome, Camila</em> was displayed in big, bold text, and a loading icon popped up underneath.</p>

<p>"Told ya," Hunter said with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Thanks," was all Amity responded with.</p>

<p>Vee went to go make herself a bag of popcorn. She probably had a few minutes before they figured out what <em>Watervixen</em> was.</p>

<p>Gus poked his head over Amity's shoulder. "Ooh, what's that?" He pointed at an icon of a piece of a paper. <em>The Cadet and The Captain</em>, its label read.</p>

<p>Amity dragged the mouse over to the icon and double-clicked. The fans on the tower whirred to life as the text editor application loaded up. Once the app fully loaded, the gang looked upon page after page of writing.</p>

<p>"<em>The battle of Gafinilar was finally over. Mila Ceda, a fresh-faced cadet just out of training, and Iman Rodrig, well-seasoned captain of the GSO Voyager, were the sole survivors of the conflict.</em>" Willow read aloud.</p>

<p>"I feel like this is something that's meant for Mrs. Noceda's eyes only," Hunter chimed in.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I agree. Let's see if we can find how to access the internet, instead," Gus added.</p>

<p>The group looked over the rest of the icons on the desktop, trying to figure out which one would lead them the the mother-lode of human knowledge.</p>

<p><em>Dotify</em>? Nope, some kind of music catalogue.</p>

<p><em>Eris</em>? Looked promising initially, but turned out to be a sort of chat program.</p>

<p><em>FreeCanvas</em>? Obviously not what they were looking for. Could be fun for drawing stuff later, though.</p>

<p>As the group worked their way alphabetically down the list of applications, the final one left was something called <em>Watervixen</em>. The logo was a fox in a drop of water chasing after its own tail, or something like that. They couldn't really tell with how low quality the icon was.</p>

<p>Amity double-clicked to open the application, and once it finished loading they were greeted to a screen chock full of images and text.</p>

<p>"5 Strange Things Millionaires Do With Their Money," one headline read.</p>

<p>"The Easiest Tangy Cucumber Salad," another boasted.</p>

<p>"Crying can teach you a lot about yourself," yet another proclaimed.</p>

<p><em>That's a Titan-damned lie,</em> Hunter thought to himself. He cried all the time and still had no idea who or what he really was.</p>

<p>Vee returned with her popcorn, tossing a few kernels up into the air and catching them in her mouth. "Hey guys. I see you found the web browser."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but we have no idea how to use it," Willow complained.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's really easy. You just go to the search bar and type in what you want," Vee explained.</p>

<p>"And how do we do that?" Amity asked.</p>

<p>"You see that little box at the top of the screen? Click on that." Vee pointed.</p>

<p>The lavender-haired witch moved the mouse up and clicked inside the box. A blinking cursor appeared.</p>

<p>"Boom. Easy as that. Now just type in whatever you want to search and press the <em>Enter</em> key."</p>

<p>Amity pondered what their first internet search would be, when an idea struck her.</p>

<p>As the web results for "sweet potato" loaded in, the witches and Hunter looked on in amazement. Vee, on the other hand, just sat back and tossed a few more pieces of popcorn in her mouth.</p>

<p>She gave them about 15 minutes before they managed to download some sort of virus that would destroy the computer and probably demand 73 trillion KittyCoin be wired to some account in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p><hr />

<p>"I can't believe the Earth is actually flat. It looks so round from all the pictures we've seen."</p>

<p>"You really fell for that nonsense? It's obvious that the planet is actually donut shaped."</p>

<p>"I just can't believe we've been living in a simulation this whole time. Does reality actually mean anything, or is this all just a collection of 1s and 0s that fabricate a universe for us to live in?"</p>

<p>"I am surrounded by morons. All of you are letting this junk mess with your minds."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what an undercover agent for the top secret government mind control regime would say!"</p>

<p>"Just give me the mouse. I swear I'm not going to do anything bad."</p>

<p>"Yeah right, like I'd trust anything a globe-earther like you would say."</p>

<p>"I am ten seconds away from disconnecting this computer unless you apologize right now."</p>

<p>"Never! The people must know the truth!"</p>

<p>Vee felt around the bottom of the bag, scrounging for any stray kernels. None left. Darn. She crumpled up her 4th bag of popcorn and shot it at the trashcan across the room. It clanged off the edge and fell to the floor with a sad thud. Maybe she wasn't cut out for the GHS girl's basketball team after all.</p>

<p>Luz opened the front door to the Noceda household, a bag of groceries in each arm.</p>

<p>"Hey everyone, we're back from the- What the <em>HOOT</em> is going on here?!"</p></body></html>
