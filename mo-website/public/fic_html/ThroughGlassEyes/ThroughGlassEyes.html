<p>Surrounding her on all sides were row after row of puppets. The majority of them appeared to be of older witches and demons. At least that meant that the children were safe and sound.</p>

<p>Hopefully.</p>

<p>From her perch, she gazed down upon Luz's friends, all of whom had also been turned into puppets. Unlike her, though, they didn't even get the dignity of being placed upright. They all laid on the cold, stone floor of the Archives, arms and legs splayed out in every direction. If Camila didn't know any better, she would have thought they were sleeping.</p>

<p>But they weren't sleeping. They couldn't. Like her, they were always awake for this constant torment, eyes forced open.</p>

<p>She could hear everything, too. Every creak and moan as the others around her shifted on their posts. The monotony of it was occasionally broken by the <em>CLICK-CLICK-CLICK </em>of that green-haired excuse for a mother walking about in her heels as she carried puppets to and fro. At least she appeared to be going through hell as well. On even rarer occasions, the little space cherub himself would make an appearance, picking a selection of puppets to "play" with before snapping their finger and disappearing off to who knows where.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Camila had never been selected to be a member of the Collector's playtime.</p>

<p>Wait, what was that? She swore she just heard a sound. Like someone had picked up one of the puppets.</p>

<p><em>Ay dios mio</em>, it was Amity! Camila didn't know how the young girl was moving, but she was. Ever so slowly, the witch who had captured her precious Lucecita's heart was tracing out something.</p>

<p>As Amity's drawing progressed, Camila realized what it was: the light glyph.</p>

<p><em>Go! Go Amity! You can do it!</em> She wanted to shout, but her mouth refused to open.</p>

<p>As the lavender-haired witch finished the glyph, it morphed into a ball of light and Amity turned from puppet to witch, slowly rising to her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh my gosh, it worked!" Amity said. If Camila could talk, she would be repeating that sentiment. She didn't know how exactly drawing that glyph had freed her daughter's girlfriend, but it did nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Miss Lilith?" Amity continued, looking up towards her former mentor. Camila had mixed feelings about the elder Clawthorne sister. While she had tried to outright kill Luz by dropping her into a pit of spikes and had cursed Eda, she had also apparently redeemed herself and earned the title of "Cool Aunt Lilith" according to Luz.</p>

<p>Hunter, Willow, and Gus had likewise turned back into their normal forms thanks to the glyph. They all groaned and blinked their eyes wearily. Camila wished she could jump down from her post and comfort them. She couldn't do that, though. These children were being forced to fight to protect their families, their homes, and all she could do was watch.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Gus shouted. "AHH! Where the heck are we?"</p>

<p>"These must be the Archives," Willow said, climbing to her feet.</p>

<p>Gus looked up and met eyes with Camila. "Camila! Willow, help me get her down."</p>

<p>The two summoned their palismen before Amity interrupted them. "Guys, where's Luz?"</p>

<p>Gus and Willow mounted their palismen and began flying up to retrieve Camila.</p>

<p>Before they could do so, though, they were interrupted again. Dozens of balls of light floated into the room and slowly fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"What is this?" Amity asked. Nobody dared to answer.</p>

<p>Camila knew, though.</p>

<p>She knew what those lights meant. Just hours, before she had seen Flapjack, Hunter's palisman, sacrifice himself to bring his owner back from the dead.</p>

<p>As the lights fell, Camila knew that a sacrifice had been made. She didn't know who it was for, but she knew who had done it.</p>

<p>Luz.</p>

<p>Her daughter. The light of her life. She was gone.</p>

<p>And so, Camila cried.</p></body></html>
