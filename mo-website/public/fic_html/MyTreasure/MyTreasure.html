<p>Vee, who was positioned comfortably in a bean bag, stuck her tongue out as she translated each word in her head. "<em>Ich sehen die Katzen,</em>" she said, but it sounded wrong the second the words left her mouth.</p>

<p>"Close. You said, 'I see the cats.' Plural. You would want to say, 'Katze' without an 'n' for just one cat," Masha corrected. "Oh, and pro tip: While <em>sehen</em> is technically correct, if you are doing something yourself, you can usually drop the suffix at the end of the verb. Like, if I was going to say 'I run fast,' I would say '<em>Ich laufe schnell</em>' instead of '<em>Ich laufen schnell.</em>' Fun little quirk of German."</p>

<p>"Huh, that is interesting! Are there any other little tricks you can teach me?"</p>

<p>"Those will all come in due time, <em>mein Schatz</em>."</p>

<p>"You keep saying that phrase. '<em>Mein Schatz</em>'. What does that mean?" Masha had constantly been using that phrase since Vee had first started her lessons, dropping it at least once every time they would come over to the Noceda house.</p>

<p>"Well, it directly translates to 'My treasure', but most often it's used to refer to someone's sweetheart."</p>

<p>Vee thought about those implications before she blushed furiously. Masha was calling her their sweetheart. That was absolutely precious. <em>Oh Titan, strike me down now before I die of a nosebleed,</em> Vee thought.</p>

<p>"Oh. That's cute. I mean, cool!" Vee stammered out, blushing even more thanks to her slip up.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to stop calling you that?" Masha asked.</p>

<p>"No!" Vee said, perhaps a little too quickly. She took a deep breath, trying to get the blushing to go away. "Let's just continue the lesson."</p>

<p>Masha cocked an eyebrow. "Alright then. This one is a little bit harder. What does '<em>Wie heisst du?</em>' mean in English?"</p>

<p>That was an easy one! "What's your name?" Vee responded confidently.</p>

<p>"Correct! If I asked you that, what would you respond?" Masha copied their partner's smile.</p>

<p>"<em>Ich heisse Vee Noceda,</em>" Vee answered proudly, puffing up her chest.</p>

<p>"Ding, ding, ding! Good job!" Masha congratulated the basilisk, and Vee did a small celebratory fist pump. "Alright," they continued, "here is a trickier one: how would you politely ask someone to close the door?"</p>

<p>Vee closed her eyes and concentrated as she worked through the translation process. Can becomes <em>konnen</em>, but since she was talking to a person directly (which meant <em>du</em> would show up) it would become <em>kannst</em>. The door was <em>die</em> <em>Tur</em>, that she was sure. <em>Bitte</em> means please, so that has to be there as well. What was the word for close, though? <em>Scheissen</em>? Something like that? Eh, it was probably close enough.</p>

<p>"Would it be, '<em>Kannst du die Tur bitte scheissen?</em>'" Vee said, not 100% sure she was right.</p>

<p>Masha burst out laughing. They turned and buried their face into one of Luz's pillows to muffle the laughter, punching the matress repeatedly.</p>

<p>"Did I do something wrong?" Vee asked, walking over to see if Masha was okay.</p>

<p>"No, no, you're fine. It's just -" Masha righted themselves, but they could barely talk without laughing, "You said, 'Can you please <em>shit</em> the door', not 'shut the door.'"</p>

<p>For the second time that night, Vee blushed, but this time out of embarrassment. She then facepalmed, before slowly dragging her hand down her face. Masha will never let her forget that, will they?</p>

<p>Finally containing their fit of laughter, Masha corrected Vee's blunder. "The word you are looking for is <em>schliessen</em>. <em>Kannst du die Tur bitte </em>schliessen<em>?</em>"</p>

<p>"Ahh, thanks. Let's just do one more and then call it a night. I don't think I can recover my reputation after that," Vee said.</p>

<p>"Eh, don't worry," Masha replied. "What to ask? Hmm..." They tapped their chin in an exaggerated manner. "Ah, I know!"</p>

<p>"Alright, I'm ready," Vee said, preparing to ace the final question.</p>

<p>"How would you respond to me asking you, '<em>Wirst du mein Schatz sein?</em>'" Masha asked with a confident smirk.</p>

<p>Vee worked at translating the question. <em>Wirst</em> is will. <em>Du</em> and <em>mein</em> are you and my, respectively. <em>Schatz</em> is sweetheart, as she learned earlier. Finally, <em>sein </em>means to be.</p>

<p>Will you my sweetheart be?</p>

<p>No, that wasn't right.</p>

<p>Vee reordered it mentally.</p>

<p>Will you be my sweetheart?</p>

<p>
  <em>Oh dear Titan, Masha just asked me out.</em>
</p>

<p>"Yes!" Vee shouted.</p>

<p>Masha simply smiled. They couldn't believe their luck.</p></body></html>
