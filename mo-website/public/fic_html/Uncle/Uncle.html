<p>Uncle was mad again.</p>

<p>Bailey peeked over the railing to see Uncle launch the remote at the TV, but he missed, the remote instead smashing against the wall. A bottle was in Uncle's left hand, half-empty, with more empty bottles scattered about on the floor.</p>

<p>He'd been drinking again. Great.</p>

<p>Slowly making her way down the stairs, careful to avoid the rotting third step, Bailey called out to Uncle.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to get you another beer, Uncle Philip?" She said, careful to make sure she addressed him properly. Uncle didn't like it when she just called him Philip. Or Phil. He also probably wouldn't like what Bailey called him in her head. Unconsciously, she lightly traced her fingers over the thin, raised lines that peppered her arms.</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh yeah. You exist. Get me one of the, uh, green ones, and grab my meds while you're over there, too," Uncle replied from his seat, not even turning to face his niece, instead making a half-hearted point in the direction of the kitchen with his thumb.</p>

<p>"Of course, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>Bailey hurried past, wading through the ocean of garbage and other unpleasant things that littered the floor. Entering the kitchen, she first opened the fridge, searching for Uncle's beloved alcohol. Inside, there were only cans of Coors Light and a few glass bottles of Kirin, along with some expired Chinese food that looked to be molding over. No Heineken in sight, though.</p>

<p>"All we have is Coors and Kirin, Uncle Philip!" Bailey shouted, her head buried in the fridge, looking for any green bottles that would save her from Uncle's upcoming drunken rampage.</p>

<p>"Fuck. Get me a Coors, then. Kirin tastes like piss, anyways," Uncle replied. Bailey retrieved one of the cans and set it out on the tiny island that acted as their kitchen table.</p>

<p>Next up, Uncle's meds. Even before Bailey was born, Uncle was on a constant stream of differing medications. Sometimes he would be on one brand for a month or two, but others he would give up on after just a few days. Bailey didn't know what exactly was wrong with Uncle, but whenever she would ask, he would get angry, so she eventually learned to stop asking questions.</p>

<p>It was better that way, really. Now, Uncle would only get mad because he was either blackout drunk, a politician he didn't like said literally anything at all, or one of his sports teams lost.</p>

<p>Searching the cabinets under the sink, Bailey looked for the right box that contained whatever brand of meds Uncle was on right now. Shoving past the empty boxes that still needed to be thrown out, she finally found the white-and-green box one she was looking for, <em>Prolia</em> stamped on it in big green letters.</p>

<p>She grabbed that one. She wasn't sure that was the right one, but, honestly, she didn't care. There were a lot of things Bailey didn't care about.</p>

<p>There were a few things that Bailey cared about, though. Or, to be more specific, a few <em>people</em>. The Parks, who lived a few houses down and on the other side of the street, had an open-door policy when it came to visitors. That meant that Bailey was free to crash at their house whenever Uncle got mad. Which was a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mr. Park were the parents Bailey wished she could have had growing up. Of course, Uncle thought that the two of them were "a spit in the face of God" and that they were corrupting Bailey with their "sinful lifestyle," but she thought otherwise.</p>

<p>The Park's son, Willow, was the closest thing Bailey had to a friend. Whenever Bailey would show up unannounced at the front door, Willow would always be the first person there to greet her. Some of the best moments of Bailey's life had been when she was with Willow and her dads. She could talk about anything and everything with Willow. She was always ready to lend an ear to hear Bailey rant about whatever at a moment's notice. While inside the Park's house, Bailey was free from the horrors that would await her when she eventually returned back to Uncle.</p>

<p>And, of course, whenever she would eventually return from the Park's house, she would get reamed out by Uncle about "consorting with those heathens across the street." And he would always use that... <em>other</em>... name when he was lecturing her. The name that Bailey hated. The one that sounded like when those old-fashioned TVs were just playing static. At least, that's what it sounded like to her. Uncle always said that name with a certain vitriol.</p>

<p>Grabbing the beer and the medicine, Bailey quietly placed the requested items on the end table next to Uncle's favorite recliner. Uncle didn't react, apparently having fallen asleep while Bailey was reminiscing about the brief times when her life wasn't a complete shitshow.</p>

<p>After yet again slogging her way through the piles of trash that coated the floor, Bailey turned to look at the man who had taken over every aspect of her life all those years ago. Bailey would do anything to get away from him for good.</p>

<p>Climbing back up the stairs, still avoiding the third step from the bottom, she returned to her closet of a room. Taking a seat at the foot of her cot, she thought of all the ways that she could escape Uncle.</p>

<p>Maybe she could go live with the Parks forever. They wouldn't mind, right? Of course, Uncle would be close by if that was the case.</p>

<p>Or maybe she could call CPS. Surely her living conditions were breaking some sort of law and they could put Uncle away for something.</p>

<p>Or maybe she could become a vagabond, moving from town to town, bindle draped over her shoulder as she stowed away on boxcars headed for Bangor or Elmira or some podunk town like that.</p>

<p>Or maybe that was just wishful thinking.</p></body></html>
