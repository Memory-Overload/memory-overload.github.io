<p><strong>Kriegstag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>Peace and quiet was a rarity in the Owl House, but with King dozing
off on the couch and her daugh her apprentice off running around with
Goops at Hexside, Eda finally had some time to herself. Claiming the
kitchen table as her work station, the Owl Lady reached into her hair
and withdrew one of her purchases from last night: a large picture
frame. She then reached in again and brought out Luz’s shed, carefully
laying it out on the table. Flipping the frame over, Eda took the back
cover off and slid the stock photo out after turning the little tabs
holding it in place. Looking at the photo, she saw a witch laughing
happily with her two children. Eda stared at the picture a few seconds
too long before she crumpled it up and set it ablaze with a quick spell
circle.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, right. Like that’ll ever happen.</em> Luz was her
apprentice and King was her roommate, and that was all they would ever
be. But, then again, the basilisk had called her “Mamá” on multiple
occasions now, and she had practically raised King for the last 8 years
or so. Even though they were as close as could be, when Eda was doing
her potions apprenticeship and training with Ms. Sarrasri, Titan rest
her soul, she had never once slipped up and called “Mom”. As for King,
well, Eda was pretty sure that there weren’t many 8 year olds living
with a 43 year old unless they were… family. Whether she liked it or
not, Eda had to admit that she cared deeply about both of those
kids.</p>
<p><em>Titan, this is all so confusing.</em> The Owl Lady let out a
groan and buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of silence, Eda recomposed herself up and focused
back on the task at hand. She first smoothed the skin as best she could,
gently squeezing out the folds and wrinkles until it all laid flat on
the table. She then laid the skin over the picture frame. The frame
itself was smaller than the skin, so there would need to be some folding
for it all to fit. Once the skin was neatly folded and completely inside
the frame, Eda replaced the back panel of the frame and turned the
notches so that it would all stay put.</p>
<p>Luz was going to love this.</p>
<p>Eda grabbed the picture frame and carried it into the living room.
Where should she hang it? After some careful deliberation (read: finding
the only place where the frame would fit), she decided that the best
spot for it was right next to her own framed wanted poster. After
roughly jamming a nail into the wall, she balanced the frame on the nail
so that the shed was perfectly upright.</p>
<p>As Eda looked at her apprentice’s molten skin hanging on the wall,
though, she came to a realization. While the Owl Lady was all that and
then some when it came to being the most powerful witch on the Boiling
Isles, she knew diddly squat about actually teaching the finer points of
spell-casting and magic in general.</p>
<p>Letting out a begrudging sigh, Edalyn Clawthorne finally accepted
that it was time to enroll her daughter/student at Hexside School of
Magic and Demonics.</p>
<p>As Gus showed Luz around campus, the basilisk couldn’t help but
notice the strange figures patrolling the hall. Every so often, she
would see them dragging students off to some unknown location with a
hook. Finally, as the two sat down for lunch, her curiosity got the best
of her and she needed to know what was going on.</p>
<p>“Hey, Gus?” Luz asked between bites of her sandwich. She was still
was getting used to the new raspier voice that came out of her
mouth.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Alex?” Gus was adamant about keeping Luz’s cover, so he never
referred to her by her actual name.</p>
<p>“What’s with the weird eyeless guys who keep smelling students?” One
of said weird figures had gotten awfully close to Luz when she and Gus
were heading to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>“Oh, those are just the trouble guards, don’t mind them,” Gus
explained. “Bump always brings them in when the Emperor’s Coven is going
to inspect the school soon. He’s usually pretty lax with the rules, and
he’ll let stuff slide if it isn’t too serious. Like, yeah, if you try
and fight someone you’ll get in trouble, but if your uniform isn’t
following dress code or whatever, he’ll typically turn a blind eye.”</p>
<p>“So, Bump brings these guys in to crack down on fights and stuff?”
Luz wished Gravesfield High was like that. The teachers and the singular
resource officer they staffed were apparently blind when it came to a
student being in distress.</p>
<p>“Pretty much. Fights, rule breaking, stuff like that,” Gus
replied.</p>
<p>Another question popped into Luz’s head. “Wait, would they be…
activated, or whatever, if <em>I</em> broke a rule? Like, I’m not a
student.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I’d rather not find out,” Gus responded.</p>
<p>“That’s probably a good idea,” Luz agreed.</p>
<p>The next few minutes of their lunch were of peaceful silence, until a
new voice grated against Luz’s eardrums.</p>
<p>“Hello, Augustus,” Mattholomule introduced himself, practically
slamming his lunch tray down onto the table.</p>
<p>“Hi, Matt,” Gus replied, not even bothering to turn his head and look
the new arrival in the eye.</p>
<p>“So, this is the ‘human’ you’re bringing in to verify my 100% genuine
artifacts?” Matt looked Luz up and down with a smirk on his face.</p>
<p>“Yes. Her name is Alex, and she has very kindly –” Gus began.</p>
<p>“The illusion isn’t even that good,” Matt interrupted. “You know, for
being a so-called expert, you got a lot of things wrong. For starters,
human hair doesn’t come in that color, and the irises are far too
bright. Oh, and don’t even get me started on that outfit.”</p>
<p>Luz took a deep breath and calmed herself down. Man, she wanted to
punch this kid in the face so hard. Nobody talks bad about her
friends.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, do you ever shut up?” she asked rhetorically. This kid
obviously loved hearing the sound of his own voice.</p>
<p>Matt gasped. “So the illusion can speak. Well, at least you got one
thing right, Augustus.”</p>
<p>“<em>Gus</em>,” she said, emphasizing her friend's preferred name,
“is an awesome illusionist, and he didn’t do anything wrong. Do you want
to know why? Because I’m not an illusion! I’m a human!”</p>
<p>“You sure don’t look like one,” Matt responded flatly.</p>
<p>Under the table, Luz balled her fists, clenching and unclenching them
so they weren’t being planted in this bozo’s face. “It’s called hair dye
and contact lenses, ever heard of ‘em? God forbid I want to express
myself.”</p>
<p>“Still doesn’t explain the ears. You could just be some random witch
Augustus paid off to pose as a human. Those round ears could just be an
illusion. I’m not convinced.” Matt crossed his arms in defiance.</p>
<p>Luz slowly exhaled. <em>I will not punch this kid in the face. I will
not punch this kid in the face. I will NOT punch this kid in the
face.</em> “Alright, that’s fine,” she said, forcing a smile and putting
on a faux cheery voice. “You can go on believing whatever lie you’re
telling yourself. When I prove your artifacts are junk, maybe you’ll
think otherwise, though.”</p>
<p>With a grunt, Matt picked up his lunch tray and went to go sit at
another table, leaving Gus and Luz to eat their lunch in peace. Pushing
her own tray over to the side, Luz folded her arms on the table and
rested her chin on her forearms.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that,” Luz apologized. “I think I went a little
overboard. I just <em>really</em> hate bullies.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be sorry,” Gus said. “We’ll all feel better once we show up to
the meeting and prove Matt wrong in front of everybody.”</p>
<p>For the second time that day, someone came barging into Principal
Bump’s office. Though he initally assumed it was going to be Miss
Noceda, it was actually her mentor that came through his doors
unannounced. Without even saying a word, Edalyn flipped the chair in
front of her around and then straddled it, crossing her arms over the
back of the chair and looking Bump in the face.</p>
<p>“Let me talk to ya, Bumpykins,” she started.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me that,” the principal replied instinctively. “Also, why
are you even here?”</p>
<p>Edalyn grabbed his nameplate and began tossing it from hand to hand.
“What, no chit chat?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not, thank you. I am quite busy today,” Bump explained.
Spinning a quick spell circle, he righted the chair and returned his
nameplate back to his desk.</p>
<p>“Psh, you’re no fun,” the Owl Lady responded after she had flipped
back around to face the principal. She took a deep breath and blew a
strand of hair out of her face before continuing. “I’m here to enroll
my… apprentice Luz at Hexside. Now, before you start acting all
defensive –”</p>
<p>“Took you long enough,” Bump interrupted.</p>
<p>“You son of a – Wait, what?” Edalyn was shocked that the principal
had apparently been waiting for this to happen.</p>
<p>Bump rose from his seat and walked over to a file cabinet, unlocking
it and pulling out a stack of files. “I’ve seen how Miss Noceda acts
with members of our student body,” he said. “She would fit in perfectly
as a student here. You know, if you didn’t barge in just now, I would
have most likely offered Miss Noceda a spot here by the end of the day
regardless.”</p>
<p>“Hold up, really?” The Owl Lady had a look of amazement on her
face.</p>
<p>“Yes, really,” Bump replied as he returned to his seat. He then
slammed the files down on his desk. “Though, since you’re here, I have
something I’ll need you to do first before I consider handing over the
application.”</p>
<p>Eda stared at the files. She recognized each and every one of them.
Though, she couldn’t help but feel that something was off.</p>
<p>“Huh, I thought there’d be more,” she said with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for coming on such short notice to this emergency
meeting,” Gus began. “Given this morning’s, ehem, ‘incident’, I’ve
pulled a few strings and I would like to introduce you to…”</p>
<p>“Alex” sprinted into the room and started running laps around the HAS
members, the theme from <em>Ricky</em> blaring from her phone, which she
held aloft like a torch.</p>
<p>“Alex Zura, a real human!” Gus finished.</p>
<p>“Alex” paused the song and stopped to catch her breath. Man, she
thought that running for her life on the daily would give her better
cardio, but, alas, that was not the case. She held up a finger, taking
in deep breaths. Once she had fully recouped her energy, she introduced
herself to the club members.</p>
<p>“Hey, everyone! I’m Alex, and Gus here has brought me in to help
verify the authenticity of some artifacts. Is that right?” She turned to
Gus to make sure everything was going to plan, to which he slightly
nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Alex,” Gus confirmed. “We don’t want to waste any more
of your time, as I know you have a very busy schedule, so would you be
willing to start doing the verification now?”</p>
<p>“I would love to, Mr. Porter.” “Alex” moved to approach the table,
which contained both artifacts brought forth by Gus and by Matt. Luz
could instantly tell that the “artifacts” that Matt had provided were a
bunch of fakes. It was nearly comical how phony they looked. She had to
ham it up for the crowd, though, so “Alex” first examined one of Gus’
artifacts.</p>
<p>Picking up an empty bag of potato chips (which had been mistakenly
labelled as a “pillow case”), “Alex” scrutinized the bag, looking at it
from every which angle, sniffing the contents, and even wiping a speck
of salt from the bottom of the bag and tasting it.</p>
<p>“After a cursory analysis, I have confirmed that this article did,
indeed, come from my realm,” she proclaimed.</p>
<p>“Score 1 for Augustus!” Bo shouted. Gus gave a fist pump in
celebration, and Matt let out a small growl that Gus’ objects were
actually real.</p>
<p>Moving to the next artifact on the table, “Alex” picked up a “gulf
ball” and looked it over. Luz had to admit that this one at least was
somewhat correct. It was a roughly spherical rock that had been painted
white and had a few small holes drilled into it. If she was being
completely honest, this looked like something she could find in the
garbage.</p>
<p>“Hmm… This artifact is significantly harder, as it lacks any
distinctive Human realm-only features,” she began. “As such, I can not
rightly state whether this is from the Human Realm or not.”</p>
<p>“That’s snorse dung you [CENSORED]!” Matt shouted, rising to his feet
and pointing a finger at “Alex”. “That is a real human artifact! Titan,
are you even an actual human? Go ahead, Augustus, drop her illusion.
Show us who she really is!”</p>
<p>“You want me to show who I really am? Fine. How’s this?” Luz didn’t
care about keepig up the act anymore. She was pissed at this kid. All at
once, the years of bullying and torment that she had went through came
flooding back to her. Every snide comment, every backhanded insult,
every little quip. They all came back. “<em>Esto es una roca, idiota. Te
han estafado. No es una 'pelota de gulf'. Esa ni siquiera es la palabra
correcta. El deporte es 'golf', con una ‘o’!</em>” [“This is a rock, you
idiot. You’ve been scammed. It isn’t a 'gulf ball'. That's not even the
right word. The sport is 'golf', with an ‘o’!”] As she finished her
rant, Luz cocked her arm back and threw the rock as hard as she could at
the room’s window. The glass instantly shattered, and the “gulf ball”
sailed through the air before rolling to a stop a solid twenty paces
away.</p>
<p>The room was silent, save for Luz’s heavy breathing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the trouble guards burst into the room, grabbing both Luz
and Matt in their hooks before dragging them away. As the two
troublemakers were being sent off to the detention pit, Matt kept trying
to plead innocence. His pleading wasn’t working well though.</p>
<p>“Let me go, you [CENSORED]! I didn’t do anything wrong! It’s all
Augustus’ and that [CENSORED] fault! He should be the one going to the
detention pit, not me! Hey! Are you even listening to me,
[CENSORED]-for-brains?”</p>
<p>Needless to say, if Matt didn’t have a one-way trip to the detention
pit then, he sure did now.</p>
<p>Eda groaned as she wheeled over the mop and bucket. Bump now had her
cleaning off all the hexed graffiti she’d tagged the lockers with over
the years. While they were some of the finest works of her younger
years, she hated to see all that effort get washed away.</p>
<p><em>This is for Luz. I’m doing this all for Luz. It’ll be worth it
when this is all over.</em> The Owl Lady repeated that mantra over and
over in her head as she made up for all the chaos she had caused.</p>
<p>As the door to the detention pit slammed shut, Matt instantly tried
prying it back open for an easy escape. The door didn’t budge. After
kicking the door in frustration, Matt let out another string of curses
before slumping to the ground in defeat.</p>
<p>“Do you kiss your momma with that mouth?” Luz asked sarcastically.
While Luz wasn’t quite sure what they meant, Eda was particularly fond
of dropping some very spicy Boiling Isles swear words when something
went wrong with a potion, and it looks like Matt had a similar potty
mouth.</p>
<p>“Buzz off,” the Construction track witch replied. Ignoring the
command, Luz walked over to stand in front of Matt and offered him a
hand up, but he didn’t take it, leaving her hanging.</p>
<p>After the rejection, Luz crossed her arms and looked down at the
witch. “Look, man. I’m just trying to help you out, okay? We’re both in
detention, and that sucks. Can we at least work together so we can get
out of here in one piece?” She offered her hand once again.</p>
<p>Matt stared at the offered help up before exhaling sharply. “Fine,
but I take the lead.” He pulled himself to his feet, looking annoyed the
whole time at the prospect of getting help from someone posing as a
human.</p>
<p>A rumble shook the entire detention pit as the ground in front of the
two began to separate, revealing a massive hole lined with a fleshy pink
material and row upon row of eyes and teeth. Deep into the pit, Luz
could see various students, all trapped in weird blue cocoons made out
of an odd jelly.</p>
<p>“Starting already? Wow, they don’t mess around here,” Matt said. He
then turned to Luz and added, “Now would be a really good time to drop
your disguise.”</p>
<p>The basilisk laughed. She couldn’t believe it. “You’re still telling
yourself that? Newsflash, buddy, I don’t have a disguise to drop. I
don’t have pointy ears. I can’t cast magic spells by drawing a circle
with my finger. I. Am. A. HUMAN!”</p>
<p>Matt froze. “Wait, really?”</p>
<p>“YES!” Luz screamed in frustration.</p>
<p>All the witch could respond with was a short “Huh.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a giant snake creature with a human-like face reared up
from the pit. The face itself was a sickly gray color, but the body of
the snake thing was olive green and had rings of black going down the
length it.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, the <em>Gehirnwäscheschlangen</em>. Forgot about those,”
Matt said as if nothing was out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, the what?” Luz had no idea what the witch had just
said.</p>
<p>The creature opened its mouth, and a long, slimy tongue shot out,
wrapping around Matt’s ankle before dragging him down to the bottom of
the pit at a speed which Luz could barely even comprehend.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, Matt!” Luz shouted. Another one of the snake monsters
rose from the pit and turned to face Luz, but before it could trap her
as well, she punched it on the snout, causing it to retreat. Cursing her
mother for instilling such good values in her, Luz jumped into the pit
after Matt.</p>
<p>Bouncing off a stray eyeball and landing on her feet, Luz looked for
the pod that held Matt. As it floated by over head, she quickly tore it
down and set it on the ground. She needed to get him out of this
thing.</p>
<p><em><strong>YOU WILL BE A GOOD STUDENT</strong></em>, a disembodied
voice said.</p>
<p>“I will be a good student,” Matt repeated.</p>
<p>Letting out a growl, Luz tried to rip the pod open with her bare
hands, but she couldn’t find purchase. She needed something sharp, and
Luz knew just the morph for the job. Quickly shapeshifting into the
Kraugh, she used her wrist blade to slice open Matt’s pod. Draping the
boy over her shoulder, she was surprised at how light he was. She felt
like he barely weighed more than a duck! Or maybe she was just strong.
That was probably it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Luz began quickly scaling the walls of the detention
pit, using her wrist blades like pitons, slamming them into the side of
the pit as she ascended. As a bonus, each time she drove a wrist blade
into the pit, the <em>Gehirnwäscheschlangen</em> would slink away,
further and further from the giant bladed monster the higher she
climbed. Once she reached the top of the pit, she dragged herself over
the edge and clambered to her feet. She took a few deep breaths. Man,
that climb had taken a lot out of her.</p>
<p>There was no way she was going to stay trapped in this room, so she
had to find a way to bust down that door. The Kraugh, while good for
fighting off the brain-washing snake things and climbing and such,
wasn’t exactly built for causing massive property damage. Running
through a list of animals in her mind, Luz eventually settled on one:
the rhinoceros. Though she was tired, Luz powered through it and
eventually finished the morph, though it was a slow process. Adjusting
Matt so that he was on her back, Luz backed up a few paces before
charging, full speed, at the door to the outside world.</p>
<p>The door flew off its hinges as Luz barreled through. Now that the
two of them were free, Luz finally laid down. As she did so, her body
decided that it was time to take a quick nap. As Matt rolled off her
back and faceplanted on the tiled floor, Luz blissfully entered the
realm of Sunshine Sleepy Fun Time.</p>
<p>“Edalyn?”</p>
<p>“What is it now, Bumperoni?”</p>
<p>“Would you care to explain why there is an unconscious student next
to an obese gray unicorn just outside the detention pit with the door
broken on the other side of the hallway?”</p>
<p>Steve rapped three times on the door to Matt’s bedroom. He had taken
his annual day off today so he could surprise his younger brother with a
visit. Ma had said on a CB call that Matty was finally switching over to
Hexside, and that today was his first day. Steve would be a fool if he
was gonna miss that.</p>
<p>“Go away, I don’t wanna talk,” came Matt’s voice from the other side
of the door.</p>
<p><em>Well, that doesn’t sound right,</em> Steve thought. What could
have Matty in such a bad mood?</p>
<p>Steve waited a few seconds to let the tension build before replying.
“Really? Not even to me?”</p>
<p>Steve heard a loud <em>THUMP</em>, presumably from Matty falling out
of bed, followed by the sound of his younger sibling running to open the
door. The coven scout chuckled at his sibling’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Hey, dude,” Steve greeted casually with a wave, as if nothing was
out of the ordinary and this wasn’t the first time he’d seen Matty
in-person in over a year.</p>
<p>Matt quickly wrapped his older brother up in a hug. “Steve!”</p>
<p>Steve laughed, reciprocating the embrace. “That’s my name, so don’t
wear it out!”</p>
<p>Breaking off the hug, Matt had a million questions. “How… how are you
here? <em>Why</em> are you here? Did you sneak out of Emperor Belos’
castle? Are you gonna get in trouble?”</p>
<p>“Relax, Matt. I just took my day off,” Steve explained.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Matt realized that that made a lot more sense than Steve
sneaking out of the castle.</p>
<p>“So, how’ve ya been? How’d your first day at Hexside go? Did anyone
beat my record for most healing ward visits yet?” Steve replied, asking
his own volley of questions.</p>
<p>Matt groaned. “Ugh, today was awful. You know how Hexside has a Human
Appreciation Society?”</p>
<p>Steve nodded. While he wasn’t as gung-ho about humans as Matty was,
he would always be willing to listen to his younger brother ramble on
about some human artifact he had found on the beach or had bought at the
market.</p>
<p>“Well, I attended their meeting today and wanted to show off all the
cool artifacts I’ve collected, but then Augustus got all hot and
bothered when I didn’t think his so-called ‘artifacts’ were the
real-deal. His stuff looked so fake! But then he brought in this human,
and she called all of my artifacts fakes, and then started talking in
this weird language, and we got thrown in detention, and –” Matt
rambled.</p>
<p>The coven scout held up a hand to stop Matt. “Hold on, there was a
human at Hexside? Tell me <em>everything</em>.”</p>
