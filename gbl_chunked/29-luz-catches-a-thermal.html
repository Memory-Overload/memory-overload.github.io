Thermal</h1>
<p><strong>Schlimmtag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>As Luz plodded down the stairs and into the kitchen, she loosed a
massive yawn, alerting the Owl Lady and King to her presence. She was
dressed in an oversized t-shirt and a pair of <em>Good Witch
Azura</em>-branded pajama bottoms, and her tail hung limp behind her,
poking out from a hole in the back of her pants. Taking a seat at the
table, the basilisk let out a smaller yawn and stretched her arms out
wide, feeling her shoulders <em>POP</em> as she did so. <em>Ahh, that
feels better</em>, she thought. Turning to Eda, Luz started the morning
off with a question. “Got any big plans today?”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna take over the world!” King shouted gleefully, raising a
paw to the sky.</p>
<p>Luz chuckled at the remark and rubbed King’s skull, which was the
closest she could get to giving the tiny demon an affectionate noogie.
“Sure you are, buddy. You’re gonna be the best tyrannical overlord ever.
What about you, Eda?”</p>
<p>“Not much really,” the Owl Lady answered. “I’ve got some potions
brewing, but they won’t be done for a couple days, so today’s gonna be
nice ‘n relaxing. Hopefully.” Speaking of potions, she needed to take
hers. She didn’t want to find herself in a feathery situation if she
could help it. Opening a cabinet, she withdrew one of her elixirs.
Uncorking it, she forced down the bitter concoction, feeling the magic
work its, well, magic. That should keep Bird Brain from pestering her
for a while. After wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, Eda
placed the now-empty bottle back in the cabinet.</p>
<p>She then clapped her hands together to get the other two’s attention.
“Alright, breakfast. What are we thinking?”</p>
<p>In response, Luz’s stomach growled loudly. “I’m fine with whatever,
but could I… um… have some magic, please? I did a lot of morphing
yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, sure thing. Here ya go, kid.” Eda then spun up a giant ball
of light and it floated over to Luz.</p>
<p>The basilisk gleefully drained it. “Thanks, Eda,” she said with a
smile, feeling her stomach nearly fill to the brim with all that
magic.</p>
<p>“Eh, no worries,” Eda responded. “So, back to the task at hand: food.
What do you want, King?”</p>
<p>The demon in question thought about his options before answering.
“Can we make some more of that sancocho stuff? It was really good!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re not doing that,” the Owl Lady replied, shutting down the
plan instantly.</p>
<p>“Plus, sancocho is more of a lunch or dinner meal,” Luz added. “It’s
not exactly breakfast material.”</p>
<p>King let out a huff before offering up another meal idea. “How about
griffin eggs and toast, instead?”</p>
<p>Eda smiled. “Now you’re talking my language.”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Luz hummed a little ditty to herself as she scraped everyone’s plates
free of crumbs and leftovers, offering the tiny morsels up to whatever
demon resided in their trash can. What demon it was exactly, she did not
know. Maybe it was Hooty? That made some sort of sense. He <em>was</em>
the house, after all…</p>
<p>Saving that thought for a later date, Luz was impressed with how the
meal had turned out. Eda sure knew her way around the kitchen, as
evidenced by her ability to make even the most mundane meals taste
great. The eggs had been perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the
bloodberry jelly that she’d added to the toast was not only scrumptious,
but it also gave her a little more magic to work with, which was a nice
bonus.</p>
<p>Depositing the dirty plates in the sink, Luz turned to head up to her
room to relax, but the Owl Lady stopped her. “Hold on one second, kid.
I’ve got something I want to show you.” Not waiting for the girl’s
reply, Eda turned and walked into the living room. Shrugging her
shoulders, Luz followed after, wondering what surprise the witch had up
her sleeve.</p>
<p>Coming to a stop in the middle of the living room, Eda turned to Luz.
“Notice anything different?” The basilisk looked around the room, trying
to spot what might have changed. The giant wanted poster looked like it
hadn’t been touched, and she couldn’t find anything wrong with any of
the random memorabilia hanging from the walls. The giant sword was still
there. That one pineapple grenade was still precariously hanging from
its pin. What could’ve been changed?</p>
<p>Then Luz saw it.</p>
<p>Hanging right next to Eda’s wanted poster was a picture frame, and
inside that frame was something that Luz had almost forgotten about.</p>
<p>“My shed!” Luz exclaimed. “You kept it!” She wrapped the Owl Lady up
in a bone crushing hug. “Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love
it!”</p>
<p>Eda chuckled as Luz slowly disengaged from the embrace. “That’s not
the only thing I wanted to show you, though. You know how you were
running around with Goops at Hexside yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that was a blast!” Luz replied eagerly, before she remembered
how the visit had ended. “Except for the whole getting thrown in
detention thing. That kinda sucked.”</p>
<p>“Well, how would you like to see Goops and Plant Girl every day?” Eda
asked.</p>
<p>“I mean, that would be totally awesome, but I’m not a student at
Hexside,” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, about that…” Eda reached into her hair and pulled out the
enrollment papers that Bump had given her. “I had Bumpypoo pull some
strings, and you’ll be starting next week at Hexside School of Magic and
Demonics. That is, if you want to go. This is completely up to you.” The
Owl Lady made sure to emphasize that last part. While Hexside hadn’t
exactly been Eda’s cup of tea back in the day (Thanks a lot, Fausty, you
old fart.), she knew that Luz would love it there. The whole “Friendship
and camaraderie is the <em>real</em> magic!” schtick they had was right
up the basilisk’s alley.</p>
<p>Luz couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She was actually going to
be attending Hexside! She had thought that it was just some pipe dream,
but the papers Eda held in her hand said otherwise. Luz slowly reached
her hand out, and the Owl Lady handed over the papers so that Luz could
look them over to make sure they were real and that she wasn’t imagining
everything.</p>

<p>“Had to make some assumptions ‘bout your birthday, so I just put the
day you and I first met, if that’s fine by you. You are 14, right?” Eda
explained.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am, and that’s fine,” Luz replied. “So, we’re going with the
‘I don’t have a working bile sac’ cover story so I can attend as a
witch?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I heard you and Goops talking about that, so I ran the idea by
Bump, and he gave it the okay,” Eda said.</p>
<p>Luz wrapped Eda up in another hug. “Thank you, Eda,” she
whispered.</p>
<p>Eda reciprocated the gesture, giving her apprentice/daughter a
squeeze. “No worries, kid.”</p>
<p>A sudden knock at the door drew the attention of Eda and Luz. The
basilisk was the first to move, going over to open the door and
revealing Willow and Gus standing in the doorway. Motioning for them to
come inside, she greeted them. “Hey, Gus. Hi, Willow.” The two students
weren’t in their normal uniforms, instead being decked out with Hexside
branded merchandise. Willow had on a yellow and blue jersey with the
school logo on it and a ballcap, while Gus was wearing a similarly
colored sweater.</p>
<p>“Hi, Luz, Miss Eda,” Gus said as he stepped into the Owl House. He
then noticed the papers Luz held in her hand. “Ooh, what’s that?”</p>
<p>Quickly hiding the papers behind her back, Luz gave a cheeky smile.
“Guess.”</p>
<p>“Is it… your tax return?” Willow asked, unsure of her answer, which
drew a laugh from the basilisk.</p>
<p>“Not even close. Good try though,” she turned to the illusionist.
“What do you think it is, Gus?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Gus tapped a finger against his chin. “Is it a wanted
poster?”</p>
<p>“No, but that <em>would</em> be really cool.” Luz held the papers
back out in front of her. “This is my application to Hexside. I’m going
to be starting next week!”</p>
<p>“No way! That’s awesome!” Gus could barely hide his excitement at the
prospect of Luz attending Hexside.</p>
<p>“Woah, really? What track are you going to join?” Willow asked.</p>
<p>The question caught Luz off guard. She hadn’t actually thought about
what track she would end up joining. They all seemed so cool! She would
pick all of them if she could, but it looked like she was limited to a
single option. Her top three would have to be Beast Keeping, Healing,
and Potions. Beast Keeping was a pretty obvious choice, given that she
was technically a beast demon. (The fact that the Beast Keeping coven
head was also an absolute cutey-patootie totally did not factor into
that decision.) Healing also made sense, mainly due to the fact that Luz
had practically shadowed her mom at work, and those skills she had
picked up probably translated over pretty nicely. Finally, Potions would
probably go well since Eda was practically a genius when it came to
whipping up any kind of elixir or brew and she could help Luz out
whenever she ran into a spot of trouble with her schoolwork.</p>
<p>“I’d join all of them if I could, but I would say Beast Keeping as my
first pick,” Luz finally said after deliberating for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Ooh, I’ve heard good things from students in that track,” Willow
said. “Plant track and Beast Keeping track share a few classes and they
say it’s really fun!”</p>
<p>“That’s nice,” Luz responded, before switching the topic. “So, uhh…
why are you guys here exactly? Shouldn’t you be in class?”</p>
<p>“There’s no classes today,” Gus explained.</p>
<p>“Really? Why’s that?” Luz had to admit she was a little confused.</p>
<p>“It’s the Second Schlimmtag of the Sixth Lunar Disappearance,” Willow
said, as if that was supposed to explain why they weren’t at
Hexside.</p>
<p>Luz simply blinked. What did today’s date have to do with
anything?</p>
<p>“Y’know, the traditional date for the annual Grudgby match between
Hexside and Glandus?” Gus added.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s cool,” Luz replied.</p>
<p>“’Cool’?” Gus was astounded at the basilisk’s seeming indifference to
such an important match. “It’s only the most anticipated match of the
year between the two most storied teams of all the Isles! It’s way more
than just ‘cool’!”</p>
<p>“What Gus is trying to say is that we got you a ticket and would love
it if you came with us to the match,” Willow explained.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll definitely go!” Luz said, excited at the prospect of
seeing what the Isles had in terms of sports. She then remembered who
her acting guardian was and turned to the Owl Lady to ask for
permission. “Can I go to the game, Eda?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, of course,” the grey-haired witch replied. “I was actually the
star player for the Banshees back in the day. Nobody could stop us when
we were on top of our game.” She reached into her hair and pulled out a
folded-up photo, showing a much younger Owl Lady. The Eda in the picture
had bright orange hair and a cocky smile on her face, her neck draped
with numerous medals, a trophy held up in one hand.</p>
<p>Willow, Luz, and Gus crowded around the picture. The illusionist was
the first to comment. “Wow, that’s a lot of awards.”</p>
<p>“Well, I would love to regal you all with tales from my youth, but if
you want to catch the match, you’ll probably want to head out soon. In
the meantime, I’m taking a nap, so nobody disturb me. Mama needs her
beauty sleep.” Eda tucked the photo back in her hair and left, going up
to her room to catch some much-needed Zs.</p>
<p>“When does the game start?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>Gus looked down at his watch before answering. “45 minutes.”</p>
<p>“Wait, when does the bus leave, then?” Luz followed up with.</p>
<p>The question sparked Gus’ memory. “Oh crud, the bus! We need to go
now if we want to catch it!”</p>
<p>The two students and one soon-to-be student bolted in the direction
of Hexside, hoping they could make it in time to catch the
transportation.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>As the three finally made it to Hexside, they could see a winged
demon carrying all their fellow students off to the match. A banner
trailed behind the bus, identifying it as belonging to the Hexside
Banshees. The trio came to a stop, looking on as their schoolmates
slowly disappeared from view.</p>
<p>“Aww, dang it. I can’t believe we missed the bus!” Gus exclaimed.</p>
<p>“How are we going to get to Glandus now?” Willow asked. “Dad and Papa
are both working, so they can’t give us a ride.”</p>
<p>“So is my dad, and we can’t just steal Owlbert from Miss Eda,” Gus
added.</p>
<p>As that exchange was going on, Luz was busy thinking. She had no idea
if this plan was going to work, and she especially had no idea if she
had enough magic to pull this off, but it was worth a shot. “Hey, guys,
I’ve got an idea.”</p>
<p>Willow and Gus turned to face the basilisk. “What’s your idea?” the
plant witch asked.</p>
<p>“Well, we obviously can’t walk to Glandus, and we don’t have a
palisman at our disposal, so what if I just, like, morph a dragon or
something and fly us to the match,” Luz said, explaining the basics of
her plan.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you have enough magic to do that?” Gus questioned.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure,” Luz replied. “Eda gave me some of her magic
earlier, so I’m basically operating at 100% magic capacity.”</p>
<p>“I say it’s worth a shot,” Willow said, with Gus nodding in
agreement.</p>
<p>“Alright, then can you two step back?” Luz requested. “I need some
space to do this properly.” Willow and Gus abided, moving back to give
Luz about a ten-foot radius.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Luz said, before closing her eyes and focusing on the morph
she was about to do. For what felt like the billionth time, Luz was
thankful for being a bookworm. She was basing this morph off an old
novel from the 90s she had read a few years back, called <em>Dragon
Master</em>. For a kid’s book, it had gone into a surprising amount of
detail about how a dragon’s body worked, and Luz was now eternally
grateful to the author of that book.</p>
<p>The first change that took place was her back, where two sets of
bones erupted from her spine before splaying out to their full size.
Thankfully, the bones didn’t stay naked for long, as red, leathery skin
soon spread across the bones, eventually taking shape into a pair of
wings. While it would be cool to look like a witch with a tail and
wings, Luz needed to keep the morph going. She couldn’t exactly carry
her friends in her arms all the way to Glandus.</p>
<p>The next stage of the morph focused on her head and neck. Her mouth
and nose slowly grew closer together, all the while elongating to form a
snout. Her nose eventually flattened into the snout, leaving just two
nostrils. Her neck elongated as well, making it look like someone had
stretched Luz’s neck like a putty. Then, her skin began to change, going
from smooth to scaley, growing redder until it eventually matched the
tone of her wings. Her eyes spread apart, moving to the sides of her
head, much like they did when she morphed into a horse, giving her a
much wider field of vision. Her ears also moved, sliding further back
and growing longer and pointier. To top it all off, a pair of horns
sprouted from her head. Did they serve any real purpose? No. Did they
look cool as heck? Totally.</p>
<p>Then, her arms and legs changed. Her fingers and toes shifted from
stubby, round digits to sharp claws as Luz fell to all fours, not being
able to stand upright anymore. Scales emanated from her shoulders and
hips, eventually moving to cover her entire body, save for her tail,
which still had the basilisk-type scales. Finally, her tail elongated,
dragon scales spreading from base to tip and a few tiny spikes
protruding from the tip, giving Luz a makeshift mace. With that last
change, her morph was complete.</p>
<p>Taking a few test steps, Luz inched closer to Willow and Gus. Given
that she couldn’t effectively talk right now, she instead gave a toothy
smile and attempted to flash a thumbs up, hoping to get across the
message that she was a-okay and ready to take flight. Once she figured
out how to fly, that is. She hadn’t really thought about that part when
she came up with the plan. Hopefully it was just pointing in a direction
and flapping your wings.</p>
<p>“Are you still in there, Luz?” Willow asked, to which the dragon
nodded. Luz repositioned herself and got down on her belly, allowing the
two witches easier access to hop up onto her back.</p>
<p>“This is gonna be awesome!” Gus shouted, quickly clambering up onto
Luz and getting comfy. Willow followed suit, but she had a little bit of
trouble getting her footing before she eventually made it onto her
friend’s back, placing herself between Luz’s wings.</p>
<p>Now that both her buddies were in position, Luz scratched at the
ground three times to get their attention. “You ready, Luz?” Gus asked,
to which she nodded again.</p>
<p>Slowly backing until her tail was brushing up against the stairs of
the school, Luz gave herself a runway for takeoff. Scratching the ground
twice to ready the others, Luz waited a few seconds before taking off,
running as fast as she could before reaching the tree line. Just before
she crashed into the forest, though, she squatted down and leapt with
all the strength she could muster and flapped her wings, sending the
trio up into the air.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>As Luz flew to Glandus, Willow and Gus would occasionally give
directions so that the dragon didn’t end up going the wrong way. Flying
was actually a lot easier than she thought it would be. It wasn’t tons
of constant flapping like she expected but was more of just making small
adjustments with her wings to keep herself on course as the air flowed
over her wings while she glided. Every so often, she would hit a big
bubble of warm air that would lift her up, rising under her wings as she
floated higher. Eventually, Luz caught sight of a giant building jutting
out of the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>“That’s Glandus!” Willow announced. Luz looked for a safe place to
land out of sight of anyone else, settling on a clearing just outside
the school grounds. Making more small adjustments to how her wings were
oriented, Luz slowly glided down, circling around the clearing until the
group finally touched down.</p>
<p>Gus was the first to hop off, a huge smile on his face. “That was so
cool! We have to do that again some time.”</p>
<p>Willow slowly dismounted, voicing her agreement as she did so. “Yeah,
that was way more fun than I thought it would be.”</p>
<p>As Luz quickly demorphed back into her witch-ears form (sans tail,
sadly), she copied Gus’ smile. “That was an absolute blast!”</p>
<p>Checking his watch once again, Gus let the others know how much time
they had. “The match starts in 10 minutes. If we hurry, we should be
able to find some seats.”</p>
<p>Willow turned to Luz. “So, are you ready to experience your first
Grudgby game?”</p>
<p>In response, Luz morphed herself into her own set of Hexside
merchandise. “Let’s do it!”</p>
