Throws A Mediocre Three-Person Party</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 1, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“Pay attention, kiddo. Hexes Hold’em is one of the most complex games
on all of the Isles, but it’s also one of the most popular. Any creature
worth their weight in Selkigris knows how to play,” Eda explained,
setting her deck on the table. Owlbert, who was perched across from her,
did the same.</p>
<p>“So how do you play?” Luz asked from her spot on the couch.</p>
<p>“Well, the long and short of it is that you’ve got two main types of
cards: lands and spells. Land card give you bile for certain Humors,
which can then be used to cast spell cards. Each player gets a certain
amount of health, usually 20 bits, and whoever drops to 0 health first
wins.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s just like <em>Hocus-Pocus: The Get Together</em>.” Luz
said excitedly. Back in the Human Realm, she was the founding member of
Gravsefield High’s <em>Hocus</em> club. She was also the only
member.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what that is, but sure.” Eda replied flatly. “Now,
let’s see what my hand is.” Eda drew 7 cards at random from her deck. A
mischevious smile grew on her face. “Ooh, momma likes this.”</p>
<p>Owlbert then drew his 7 cards and let out a satisfied trill.</p>
<p>Eda went first, placing down <em>Titan’s Knee</em> and casting
<em>Raging Fairy</em>.</p>
<p>Owlbert countered, putting down <em>Hidden Waterfall</em> as his land
card and attacking with <em>Gore-nado</em>.</p>
<p>The game was afoot.</p>
<p>Luz watched on, enraptured, as the two battled it out on the coffee
table. Eventually, Owlbert’s forces had nearly overtaken Eda’s, leaving
the Owl Lady with only three health left. The palisman had a smug look
on his face as Eda’s attack opportunity rolled around.</p>
<p>“Now, kid, when your opponent thinks their victory is assured, that’s
when you pull out your wild card.” Eda pulled a card from her hand and
slammed it down onto the table and all of Owlbert’s cards were instantly
incinerated. The fire then coalesced above the tble, turning into a
message that read “WINNER: EDA”.</p>
<p>“Haha, yes! In your cute little face!” Eda gloated, jabbing a finger
at her palisman. Owlbert responded with an annoyed hoot and flared his
wings, hopping off the coffee table.</p>
<p>“I love the feeling of victory. Say, have you guys seen any voles
recently?” Eda said, collapsing onto the couch and draping her arms over
Luz and King.</p>
<p>Suddenly, feathers sprouted from the Owl Lady’s arms, with more
popping up from the neckline of her dress. Distressed, Luz jumped to her
feet and yanked King into her arms.</p>
<p>“Eda, you’re a little more… feathery than normal,” King said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? I took my elixir this morning. At least, I think I
did.” Eda summoned a mirror and looked for herself.</p>
<p>“Oh this isn’t good.” Eda said, getting off the couch and running
into the kitchen. She bgean throwing all the cabinets and drawers open,
looking for the golden liquid that would placate her curse. There were
none to be found. Running up the stairs and looking in her nest-side
chest had similar results. Luz and King entered the room as she closed
the chest.</p>
<p>“Well shi-” Eda’s eyes flew to King. “-itake mushrooms, I’m all out
of elixir. Let’s hope Morton’s stocked up. Come on, kids, we’re going to
the market!”</p>
<p>&lt;hr/&gt;</p>
<p>Eda banged on the grate to the <em>Mr. Elixir</em> stand. “MORTON! I
know you’re in there! Open up before I get hungry for <em>Langue de
Nerd</em>!”</p>
<p>“Just a minute, Eda.” A voice weakly called through the grate.</p>
<p>Luz, once again donning pointed ears, and King took a seat at a
nearby bench, with Luz taking in all the wonderful oddities that lived
on the Isles.</p>
<p>Luz let out a content sigh. “Ahh, is there anything better than
people watching, King?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” King tapped his claw against his skull, thinking long and hard
about the question. “Conquering my enemies and bathing in their blood?
But beside that, no.”</p>
<p>Luz looked across the street, where she saw three witches waiting at
what looked like a bus stop. Suddenly, a massive egg fell from the sky
and cracked open upon smashing against the ground. From the remains of
the shell, a cavalcade of demons and witches emerged, hopping out and
walking away as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Given, this was the
Boiling Isles, so it was ordinary. The three witches who were waiting
carefully climbed into the shattered egg, only for it to magically
reconstruct itself and start rolling away.</p>
<p>“Wait for me!” A shrill voice cried out. Luz turned to see the
conspiracy theorist from the Conformatorium running towards the egg,
only to accept defeat and slow to a walk.</p>
<p>“Oh the curse of tiny legs.” Luz said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, being tiny sucks.” King added.</p>
<p>“But if you weren’t so tiny and adorabl, I wouldn’t be able to do
this.” Luz said, wrapping King up in a surprise hug.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Let me go you heathen!” King cried out.</p>
<p>A long, loud screeching sound assaulted Luz’s eardrums. She turned
around to see that the <em>Mr. Elixir</em> stand was now open for
business, and the namesake Mr. Morton Elixir was barely out of his
teenage years.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the hold up. I was up all night testing a new Liquid
Courage potion, and I’m not feeling the best.” The apothecary
apologized.</p>
<p>“Well sorry to break it to you, but I’m all out of elixir. I need a
fresh batch ASAP,” Eda said.</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do.” Morton said, retreating into the back of
his stand. The sound of bottles clanging together could be heard seconds
later.</p>
<p>Luz tooke the opportunity to do some more people watching. As she
scanned the pedestrians that walked around, her eyes landed on two very
familiar faces.</p>
<p>Running from the stand and over to her friends, Luz greeted Willow
and Gus.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys! How’s it going?” When the two didn’t reply, Luz noticed
the dour looks on their faces. “Wait a minute, what’s wrong? Who do I
have to go defend your honor against?”</p>
<p>“Them,” Willow said, jerking her thumb towards a group of young
witches that Luz didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>“Boscha’s having a moonlight conjuring, and she’s invited everyone
but us,” Willow explained with a frown.</p>
<p>“Plus, she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account,” Gus
added, summoning his scroll and showing the announcement post to
Luz.</p>
<p>“’Conjuring Night 2nite! No dweebs, dorks, or half-witches allowed!’”
Luz read. “What a jerk!” She paused when she realised she had no idea
what the event actually was. “Hold, on what <em>is</em> a moonlight
conjuring?”</p>
<p>“Well, you spend the night at someone’s house, and you tell stories,
you play games, stuff like that.” Willow replied.</p>
<p>“So it’s like a slumber party! We have those back in the Human Realm.
I never got invited to one though.” Luz responded.</p>
<p>“And then there’s the main event: bringing something to life with the
power of the moon!” Willow said excitedly.</p>
<p>“And there’s the twist. Should have seen that coming, honestly,” Luz
replied.</p>
<p>“Willow and I have never been to one. You need at least three
people-” Gus said.</p>
<p>Luz gasped. “I can be the third person. We’ll definitely have more
fun than them. They probably hate having fun.”</p>
<p>“Hey Half-A-Witch! Are you still looking for an invite? Too bad
you’ve got no talent, then you might have gotten one,” the triclops
bully said.</p>
<p>Willow growled and small vines burst through the ground. Luz yelped
and batted at one of them. “Hey, don’t take your repressed anger out on
them. Take it out on, like, a punching bag or something. You know what?
Let’s stick it to those snobs by having our own moonlight conjuring,”
Luz said.</p>
<p>“Really? That means I’ll finally be able to cross off something on my
bucket list!” Gus said, his face lighting up.</p>
<p>“What else is on your bucket list, Gus?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Owning a genuine human bucket. I want to store all my human
treasures in it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can probably find one in this week’s haul. You can have it
for free.”</p>
<p>“Awesome!”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m gonna go check with Eda and see if she’ll okay us doing
the conjuring at the Owl House.”</p>
<p>Luz ran back to the Mr. Elixir stand to find Morton, Eda, and King
talking about the night market.</p>
<p>“Hey Eda!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, kid?”</p>
<p>“Willow, Gus, and I want to do a moonlight conjuring tonight and we
want to do it at the Owl House. Can we do it, please?” Luz made sure to
look as cute as possible while asking, batting her eyelashes and folding
her hands in front of her.</p>
<p>Eda contemplated for a moment. She knew the kid was pretty
trustworthy, and it wasn’t like she and her buddies would be able to
animate the entire house or something. Eh, what was the worst that could
happen?</p>
<p>“Sure kid, just don’t do anything that I would do at a conjuring.
Besides, I’m gonna be doing some very not safe stuff tonight and I need
you to watch the house, so your pals can tag along as long as they don’t
break anything important.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Thank you so much, Eda. I won’t let you down, promise.”</p>
<p>Willow and Gus ran up to Luz, hoping to hear good news.</p>
<p>“So is the conjuring gonna happen at the Owl House?” Gus asked.</p>
<p>“Yup! Eda gave us the go ahead as long as we don’t break anything,”
Luz answered with a grin.</p>
<p>“Sweet!” Willow said.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna do a conjuring! We’re gonna do a conjuring! Conjuring!
Conjuring!” Willow and Gus chanted in a sing-songy voice.</p>
<p>&lt;hr/&gt;</p>
<p>As night rolled around at the Owl House, Luz glanced nervously at the
moon. She had played far too much <em>The</em> <em>Legend of Grizel:
Borrindo of Space</em> last year, and this moon looked eerily similar to
the one in the game. Hopefully this moon wouldn’t crash into the Isles
and end life as she knew it. That would kinda suck.A sudden voice
snapped her out of the trance.</p>
<p>“Luz, I’m heading out. Let your friends in when they show up, don’t
destroy the house while I’m away, and please, for the love of the Titan,
don’t let Hooty eat anything he’s not supposed to.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got it.” Luz replied, giving the Owl Lady a salute. “Hey, uh,
where’s King?”</p>
<p>“He’s right here.” Eda said, opening her cloak to reveal a sleeping
King strapped to her in a bright pink baby carrier. King let out a small
snore. “His body just shuts down when he’s like this. Watch this.”</p>
<p>Eda move from side to side and King didn’t even make a noise as his
body flopped around like a ragdoll.</p>
<p>“Aww, he’s like the world’s cutest little puppet.” Luz said, lifting
and dropping one of his feet.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’ve really got to get going. Remember, kid, you can have
fun with your friends, just don’t do anything crazy, <em>capisce</em>?”
Eda said, opening the door and stepping outside, with Luz following
suit.</p>
<p>“Mmhmm. Loud and clear. Have fun breaking the law!”</p>
<p>“You know it. Ok, byeee!” With that Eda flew off to the night market.
Luz waved goodbye for a few seconds before turning to head back
inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two bushes that Luz hadn’t noticed exploded, only to turn
into Willow and Gus, both of whom were now dressed in regular
clothing.</p>
<p>“Holy mother of Titan!” Luz screamed at the loud noise. “Oh, its just
you two. You couldn’t have given me a warning? I think I’m deaf now,
thanks.”</p>
<p>“Blame Gus. It was his idea,” Willow said immediately.</p>
<p>“What, you think I wasn’t going to do a super cool dramatic reveal?”
The illusionist replied.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well I would have thought it was cooler if my ears weren’t
ringing,” Luz said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” Gus said, looking down at the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Luz assured him. “Let’s just go inside and set up the
conjuring stuff.”</p>
<p>Luz escorted the two into the living room.</p>
<p>“So, we’ve got all your moonlight conjuring needs handled. We’ve got
snacks, we’ve got items from the Human Realm, we’ve got-”</p>
<p>Gus gasped. “A BUCKET!” The young witch ran over to the pile that was
the week’s haul from the Human Realm and yanked out a plastic
bucket.</p>
<p>“And the best part is is that we actually have enough people to do a
conjuring!” Willow added. “I just know this is gonna be great.”</p>
<p>“I never asked, how does this conjuring stuff actually work?”</p>
<p>“Well, you first have to figure out what you want to animate,” Willow
explained. “Since this is our first one ever, I think we should animate
something important. Do you have any super meaningful things from the
Human Realm?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a picture of me and my mom. Would that count?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’d be perfect. Go get it. Be fast, though. The moon will
be in position any second now.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Luz ran up the stairs, two at a time. Opening the door to
her room, she spotted the framed picture atop her dresser. Grabbing the
photo, she turned to head back down the stairs.</p>
<p>As she did so, though, the moon shifted into position. Rays of
moonlight, imbued with the magic that only a celestial allignment could
provide, shone through the window.</p>
<p>One of those rays struck Luz. As if she had been shot, the basilisk
collapsed to the ground, the picture flying from her hand and the glass
shattering.</p>
<p>A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the halls of the Owl House.</p>
