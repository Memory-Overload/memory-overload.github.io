Check</h1>
<p><strong>Friday, May 7, 2021 | Gravesfield, Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Camila Noceda had had a relatively light day so far, working as the
head of Happy Pets Clinic. Rudy, a feisty Jack Russell terrier, had to
get 27 porcupine quills removed from his snout, while Theodore, an
energetic Cocker Spaniel mix, needed a steroid injection for allergies,
and that was much easier said than done. The rest of the day had been
uneventful, however. Camila had just slumped down at her chair in the
break room when her phone began to ring.</p>
<p>Digging her phone out of her purse, she instantly recognized the
number, belonging to the front office of Gravesfield High School.
Quickly tapping the <em>Accept Call</em> button, Camila brought the
phone up to her ear.</p>
<p>“Hello, this is Camila Noceda.”</p>
<p>“Hi Dr. Noceda. Your daughter Luz has been sent to Principal Hal’s
office for her disruptive behavior in her English class. Since this is
past her second offense, we’re required to contact you and have you
appear with her while appropriate disciplinary action is taken.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for letting me know. I’ll be on my way shortly. Have a
good day.”</p>
<p>“Likewise, Dr. Noceda.”</p>
<p>Camila ended the call and then let out a long sigh. She loved Luz and
her creativity, she really did, but it sometimes got out of hand. Luz
would get so engrossed in her latest art project or book report that she
would forget to think about how others might react.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the schedule for the rest of the day, there wasn’t
much left to do, and nothing that Camila 100% needed to be there for, so
she decided to take the rest of the day off to be with Luz.</p>
<p>Packing up her belongings, Camila realized she needed to let the rest
of the staff know that she would be leaving early. Luckily, Carmen and
Dianne were the only other people working this shift, so that would be
pretty easy.</p>
<p>“Hey Carmen!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dr. N?”</p>
<p>“I need to go right now. Do you think you can cover the rest of my
patients?”</p>
<p>“Totally. I’m finishing up with Cassie right now, so I won’t have
much more after that.”</p>
<p>“Awesome. Thank you, Carmen. Can you let Dianne know I’ll be gone, as
well?”</p>
<p>“Yup. No worries, Dr. N.”</p>
<p>“Great. Thanks, again.”</p>
<p>As Camila pulled into the parking lot of Gravesfield High School, she
steeled herself as she opened the doors to the building that had been
the source of many nightmares. After checking in with the front desk and
being given a small nametag declaring her a visitor, she made her way
over to the office of Principal Hal.</p>
<p>Closing the office door, Camila saw her daughter with a forlorn look
on her face, and Principal Hal with a disgruntled look on his.</p>
<p>“Hi, mom,” Luz said quietly.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming on such short notice, Dr. Noceda,” Hal
said.</p>
<p>Camila took a seat next to her daughter before turning to face the
principal.</p>
<p>“So, what exactly is it that I was called here for? I know that Luz
was ‘disruptive’ in class, but that’s it. Would you care to enlighten me
on the situation?”</p>
<p>“Well for starters, your daughter brought a live snake to class and
used it as a prop in her book report.”</p>
<p>Camila’s eyes shot over to make contact with Luz’s.</p>
<p>“You brought Reggie with you to school? Luz, what have I told you,
you have to keep Reggie at home and in his terrarium!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, <em>mamá</em>.”</p>
<p>“I know, <em>mija</em>, but you also have to be a responsible pet
owner. Reggie could have hurt one of the other students, or even been
hurt himself. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>“Yes <em>mamá</em>. Look, he’s fine. He was never in danger.” Luz
then pulled Reggie out from her backpack, and the snake coiled himself
around his owner’s left arm.</p>
<p>“That’s good and all, but you still have to be careful, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay, mom.”</p>
<p>Principal Hal then drew the attention back onto him by opening one of
the drawers to the side of his desk. The loud <em>SKRRRRT</em> was
grating to everyone’s ears. Hal then pulled out a small pamphlet and
placed it on his desk.</p>
<p>Luz and Camila both moved up closer to get a better look at the
flyer. “Reality Check Summer Camp” was printed at the top in a garish
font, and a picture of a boy being trapped inside a box made it even
worse. The obviously fake smile on the kid’s face, along with the
tagline of “Think <u>inside</u> the box!” didn’t help much either.</p>
<p>“In light of Luz’s recent incidents, I believe that this camp would
be of great benefit to her, and it would also give her the chance to
make friends with other children her own age. This is an optional
activity, though. If you do take up the offer, it would last the entire
summer break.”</p>
<p>The two Nocedas looked over the pamphlet as it proclaimed how Reality
Check Summer Camp would teach campers about the “Wonders of Public
Radio” and “Doing Your Taxes: The Fun Way!” The document looked like it
hadn’t been updated in decades, with the “The Sharing Initiative © 2001”
at the bottom of the last page being a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you two talk this over amongst yourselves. If you could get
back with a decision by next Monday, then we could start the signup
process then. There is no rush, however. Signing up only takes a few –”
Hal was cut off by Reggie uncoiling himself from Luz’s arm and striking
at the man.</p>
<p>“REGGIE, NO!” Luz yelled, as she quickly pulled her pet off the
shocked principal. She hastily slipped Reggie into her backpack and
zipped it mostly shut, leaving a small gap at the top. Reggie still
needed to breathe, of course. Luz wasn’t a monster.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, Principal Hal,” Luz stammered out. She noticed the
vitiligo markings on her hands start to grow a little larger. That was
probably just a trick of the light or stress messing with her brain.</p>
<p>“You should be. That <em>thing</em> nearly killed me,” Hal then
composed himself before continuing, “Alright, Noceda. I was originally
going to give you the choice of going to Reality Check Camp, but now you
have forced my hand. You’ll be attending, whether you like it or not.
Consider this extended academic action. Now, please go with your mother
and leave this school before I have a resource officer escort you
out.”</p>
