Learns About The Magic Of Camaraderie</h1>
<p><strong>Kaufetag 4, Fifth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Owl
House</strong></p>
<p>“’Your reign of terror is over, Gildersnake!’ Azura proclaimed,
pointing her magic staff at the beast. The Spell of Exile was her last
hope to defeat the wretched creature. With a shout of
‘<em>Vertreibe</em>!’ and a blast of magic, the Gildersnake was
vanquished, never to harm the citizens of Hruthin ever again.”</p>
<p>Luz closed her copy of <em>The Good Witch Azura: The Darkness Strikes
Back</em> and looked down at King, eyes staring up at her with a look of
wonder.</p>
<p>“So, what do you think?” Luz asked, gauging the demon’s reaction to
the ending of the novel.</p>
<p>“It was so filled to the brim with mushy fantasy drivel that it was
actually good,” King replied, climbing to his feet amongst his
collection of plushies.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing you liked it, then? Oh, and look at the little flipbook
I drew.” Luz opened the book back up and showed King the tiny drawings
she had made in the margins. As she flipped the last few pages back and
forth, a drawing of Azura fired a blast of magic from her staff,
striking the Gildersnake, and causing it to explode into dozens of tiny
pieces.</p>
<p>King laughed at the drawings. “Hah! I can do better than that. You
know, as the King of Artists, I was renowned for my unmatched skill when
it came to drawing things exploding. I was the best!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the portal door appeared, opening to reveal Eda and Owlbert
walking through the divide between realms. Behind him, Owlbert dragged a
giant burlap sack stuffed to the brim with random items from Luz’s
neighborhood.</p>
<p>“All right freeloaders, it’s market day. That means we’ve got to set
up shop early before someone steals my spot,” Eda said, grabbing the
sack from Owlbert and slinging the human goods over her shoulder.
Reaching down, she then scooped King up with her free arm. “Come on,
let’s go!”</p>
<p>The streets of Bonesborough were quieter than normal for this time of
day. Usually, there would be a constant droning in the background of
hundreds of voices screaming, all trying to get passersby to buy
whatever item they were peddling. Luz didn’t mind the quiet, though, as
it allowed her to re-read <em>The Good Witch Azura:</em> <em>Revenge of
the Gildersnake</em> without constantly being interrupted by something
trying to eat her.</p>
<p>As Luz turned the pages, she couldn’t help but occasionally run her
fingers over her now-pointed ears. Sure, she could have gone out as the
Kaugh, but that transformation took a lot of magic to pull off. Magic
that, while overly abundant given her being in a realm full of
magic-filled witches and demons, she didn’t feel right taking from
others.</p>
<p>Except for Warden Wrath. He could step on a colorful interlocking
plastic brick for all she cared.</p>
<p>So pointed ears on an otherwise human Luz it was. Heck, she looked
like an actual witch now! (Even if she didn’t have the awesome outfit
that Azura always wore.)</p>
<p>“Where is everybody?” Luz asked, looking up from her book. <em>Human
Collectibles</em> was the only stand around. “Are they all playing hide
and seek or something?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea, kiddo,” Eda answered, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>Just as Luz was about to return to her book, two sets of footsteps
could be heard running up to the stand. Looking up, Luz saw that it was
Willow and Gus who were the guilty party.</p>
<p>“Hey, Willow! Hi, Gus!” Luz greeted the two, closing her book and
hopping over the table.</p>
<p>“Luz, where have you been? We’ve been looking for you all day,” Gus
said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been at the Owl House, and then we came here at 9. Like we do
every market day,” Luz replied matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“Oh. Right,” Gus said.</p>
<p>“See? I told you she wasn’t at the all-you-can-beat buffet,” Willow
interjected.</p>
<p>“So, why were you guys looking for me?” Luz said, wondering what
could get the two of them so excited.</p>
<p>“Well, we wanted to invite you to come to the Covention with us,”
Willow answered. “There’s even going to be a mystery guest this
year.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, that sounds fun. But, what’s a Covention?”</p>
<p>“It’s where students from all the magic academies go to look at every
coven there are before they get placed into one after graduation.”</p>
<p>“So it’s like a magical career fair? That’s awesome!” Luz said,
elated at the prospect that she could see all the different types of
magic. “Eda, can we go?”</p>
<p>“What? Absolutely not! Coventions are where fun goes to die and all
the happiness gets squashed out of you while you get turned into a
stooge for the Emperor.” Eda responded flatly, crossing her arms and
standing her ground.</p>
<p>“Please, Miss Eda? It will be so cool and magic-y,” Luz said, doing
her best puppy-dog eyes and batting her eyelashes. She held the look for
a few seconds before Eda finally relented.</p>
<p>Eda let out a long groan. “Fine, we’ll go to the Covention. Just stop
doing that face. Its cuteness is making me sick.” She paused for a bit
before continuing. “Besides, I might as well see how the Emperor is
brainwashing you fools nowadays. Haven’t been to one since we were
kids.”</p>
<p>Luz perked up. “’We’? Who’s ‘we’?”</p>
<p>Before Luz could question her anymore, Eda cut her off by saying,
“That doesn’t matter. It happened a long time ago and isn’t important.
Let’s just get this over with.”</p>
<p>Grabbing Owlbert and magicking away everything non-essential, Eda
stomped off towards the Covention hall, with the kids following quickly
behind.</p>
<p>The gang of witches, Luz, and King stood huddled in a dark corner
outside the Covention. Eda wrestled with a cowl, trying to force her
mountain of hair to fit into the hood. Luz did her best to help,
stuffing the remaining locks into the hood with a little assistance from
King.</p>
<p>“Why do we have to do this, again?” Luz asked after Eda managed to
tuck the last strand into the cowl.</p>
<p>“To keep a low profile. Do you think I’m wanted just for
pick-pocketing bozos on the street?” Right as Eda said that, a cascade
of small trinkets and accessories fell out of her hair, clattering to
the floor. “Mostly.” Scooping up some of the fallen objects and placing
them back in her hair, she continued. “But the thing that has really got
the Emperor’s knickers in a twist is that I refuse to join a coven. So
that’s why I need the cowl. I need a disguise. I don’t want to go to
jail.” She stopped to count on her fingers. “For the fourth time.”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe seeing all the wonders of the coven system could
persuade you to join one,” Willow said hopefully.</p>
<p>Eda laughed and let out a snort. “Hah! Fat chance that’ll happen,
kid.”</p>
<p>Now donning a completely fool-proof disguise, Eda and the others
entered the Covention.</p>
<p>As the group walked through the main foyer of the hall, Luz could
barely keep her jaw from plummeting through the floor. <em>This place
looks amazing!</em> she thought, taking in all the sights. Rows upon
rows of booths filled the hall, all of them advertising one coven or
another. Above her head, student witches flew by on broomsticks. She
also couldn’t help but notice the giant banners hanging from the
ceiling. She counted 9 in total, each of them with its own distinct
color and logo.</p>
<p>Gus noticed Luz looking towards the banners and jumped in with an
explanation. “Those are for each of the nine main covens: Healing,
Plant, Beast Keeping, Oracle, Construction, Bard, Illusionist,
Abomination, and Potions. There are hundreds more to choose from,
though. You just have to find which one suits you best.”</p>
<p>“Woah,” was all Luz could respond with.</p>
<p>Picking a row at random, the group walked past all the booths that
had been set up. As they did so, Willow named off even more covens that
a witch could join. “There’s Scrying Coven, Baker’s Coven, Acting Coven,
Debate Coven, Tiny Cat Coven–”</p>
<p>Eda groaned from the back of the group.</p>
<p>“And how could I forget the Grumpy Coven?” Willow continued without
missing a beat.</p>
<p>“You wanna repeat that?” Eda said, disgruntled at the remark.</p>
<p>Willow let out a yelp as she ran away from the annoyed Owl Lady, with
Luz, Gus, and King following close behind.</p>
<p>As the gang neared the end of the row, they turned back around, just
in time to see Eda throw a small blue bag in some random witch’s face
before yanking their hood over their head. As the Owl Lady ran over to
meet back up with the kids, Luz saw the <em>cutest</em> little fox
creature she’d ever seen.</p>
<p>The fox-like demon was seated on a stool, postured in a very proper
manner. It stood at roughly the same height as a child, and it was
dressed in a sleeveless gray tunic, torn-up brown shorts, and dark brown
boots. Luz could also see that the demon had a mess of auburn hair and
burnt orange fur.</p>
<p>Luz couldn’t help herself. She ran over as fast as her legs could go
and began petting the absolutely adorable demon. While it was initially
hesitant to the sudden contact, it relented, giving in to the affection.
The demon’s fur was surprisingly smooth and silky, Luz realized.
Switching tactics after a few seconds and rubbing her finger under the
demon’s chin, it let out a small yawn.</p>
<p>“Luz, stop that! That’s Eberwolf. He’s the head of the Beast Keeping
Coven,” Willow said, chastising Luz for her behavior.</p>
<p>“But he’s so cute!” Luz rebutted, now giving Eberwolf head rubs.</p>
<p>“Yes, and he can also have you thrown in the Conformatorium. Let’s
check out the other covens.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Bye Mr. Eberwolf!” Luz said, waving goodbye, which the demon
enthusiastically matched.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a light-blue clone of Luz popped into existence behind her,
peeking over her shoulder. “Bye Mr. Eberwolf!” the clone repeated,
before running over to another booth and vanishing into a nonexistent
wind.</p>
<p>“Woah, what was that?” Luz asked, astounded.</p>
<p>“Ahh. I see you’ve been drawn in by the wonders of the Illusionist
Coven,” Gus said, “We enjoy magic with a hint...” He disappeared in a
puff of smoke, only to reappear a few steps away, “of pizzazz.” He
finished with a bow as two other coven members poofed behind him, each
flanking a side.</p>
<p>“Acceptance? Camaraderie? A sense of belonging and not feeling like
an alien?” Luz couldn’t believe what she was seeing. “Covens sound like
a dream come true! Why haven’t you ever joined one, Eda?”</p>
<p>“Are ya sure about that, kid? Watch closely,” Eda said, motioning
towards another teenage witch who had been swooned by the flashiness of
the Illusionist Coven.</p>
<p>“When you fall for the bait and join a coven, all your other magic
gets locked away.” A blue sigil appeared on the pimply-faced witch’s
wrist as a light blue color spread through their veins. “Now, all that
kid can do is illusions. Nothing more, nothing less,” Eda explained.</p>
<p>She then summoned a fireball in one hand and an orb of water in the
other. “And that is why Emperor Boo-los has me as Public Enemy #1, and
why I’m also <em>the</em> most powerful witch on all of the Boiling
Isles.” She dispelled the two spheres with a wave of her hand.</p>
<p>As the group walked away from the Illusionist Coven, Willow and Gus
listed off coven after coven, each of them getting progressively more
specific. At some point, King had been lured away from the group and he
was currently AWOL. He was probably being promised dark deeds done in
his name or something silly like that.</p>
<p>“Of course, the People-Who-Look-Like-Doppelgängers Coven is a very
rare coven to get in to,” Willow said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it’s even harder to qualify for the Dross-Detecting
Coven,” Gus countered.</p>
<p>The gang, sans King, approached a doorway flanked on both sides by
guards. Above the door, a banner hung depicting two pairs of wings and a
sword on top of a triangular shield. Luz couldn’t help but think she had
seen a design similar to that back in Gravesfield. She was pretty sure
she had seen something similar on the town welcome sign. Coincidences
happened all the time, though, and this was probably no different. It
was a relatively simple design, after all.</p>
<p>Gus gasped. “I can’t believe the Emperor’s Coven is actually here
this time! Do you think I can get an autograph?”</p>
<p>“I guess we’ll have to go and find out,” Willow replied, and the two
young witches ran into the theatre.</p>
<p>Luz moved to follow after her friends, but slowed up when she noticed
that Eda hadn’t moved from her spot.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to join us, Eda?” Luz asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. The Emperor’s Coven is just a bunch of yes-witches
for Bonehead. They’re the worst of all the covens. I’m fine waiting out
here,” Eda replied.</p>
<p>“I get it. Conformity: bad. Self-reliance: good. But, I’m also still
learning all the ins and outs of this world, so I’m going to be making
my own choices and that includes whether or not I join a coven. I’m
going inside, alright?” Luz then turned and walked into the theatre.</p>
<p>After Luz found a good seat in one of the upper bowls and had sat
down, Eda rushed over and plopped down in the seat next to the
basilisk.</p>
<p>“Hey kid. Changed my mind. I want to see this hot mess go down.”</p>
<p>Just as she finished saying that, the lights surrounding the theatre
dimmed.</p>
<p>It was time for the show to begin.</p>
