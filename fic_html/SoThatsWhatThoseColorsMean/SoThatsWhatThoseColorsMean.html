<html><head><title>"So That's What Those Colors Mean!"</title></head><body><p>"Hey, Masha."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Vee?"</p>

<p>The basilisk and the enby were both laid on the couch in the Noceda family living room. Vee had her tail draped over the armrest, while the rest of her was on the seat cushions. Masha, meanwhile, had their legs hanging over the back of the couch with their head and torso being flipped upside down compared to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>"Remember you said that if I ever had any questions about human stuff, you would answer them?" Vee said.</p>

<p>"Uh huh. Lemme guess, is it about our wacky and zany Human Realm culture?" Masha supplied, shooting upside down finger guns in Vee's direction.</p>

<p>"Kinda. I keep seeing stuff everywhere mentioning 'Pride Month,' and I have zero clue what that means. I doubt its related to lions," Vee ended with a chuckle at her attempted joke.</p>

<p>Masha righted themselves on the couch to be in a normal sitting position. They thought for a second before beginning.</p>

<p>"So, you know how Luz likes both boys and girls, but Amity only likes girls?" Masha began. It would be good to start off with something Vee was familiar with.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Vee said, nodding.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure if you had any special labels for it in the Demon Realm, but here people can call themselves certain things based on who they are attracted to. Since Luz likes boys and girls, she can say that she is bisexual. Amity, on the other hand, would likely say that she is a lesbian, which is a girl who likes girls. Are you following me so far?" Masha wanted to make sure that Vee wasn't being overwhelmed with info.</p>

<p>"I think so," Vee stated. "So, since I'm a girl who doesn't like guys, would that make me a lesbian, too?"</p>

<p>"If that's what you feel best describes you, then yes." Masha replied.</p>

<p>"What if there is a boy who isn't attracted to girls, is there a name for that?" Vee asked.</p>

<p>"Well, that depends. If the boy is attracted to other boys, then he would be gay, or if he wanted to be fancy he could say homosexual. Given, gay actually applies to anyone who is attracted to the same sex, so a lesbian could say they are gay as well. The opposite of that would be heterosexual, like a guy who only likes girls and vice versa. Most people just call that a 'straight' relationship, though. But if you don't really feel the urge to... you know... 'get it on' with anyone, then you would be asexual, which typically goes hand in hand with aromanticism, where you don't feel romantic attraction. If you're both aromantic and asexual, then you would say that you are aroace for short." Vee's eyes lit up in recognition at that last part.</p>

<p>"That sounds just like how Luz described Aunt Lilith!" the basilisk exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Huh?" was all that Masha could react with. They had no idea who this "Aunt Lilith" figure was.</p>

<p>"So, Luz was being Luz, and she tried to play matchmaker with Aunt Lilith and her friend Steve, except Lilith said that she had never really felt any sort of attraction to anyone whatsoever. I guess I finally have a word for that now," Vee explained.</p>

<p>"Luz didn't try to, like, force them to date, did she?" Masha inquired.</p>

<p>"Nope, once Lilith let her know, Luz dropped the idea," Vee replied.</p>

<p>"That's good. You should always respect a person's orientation," Masha said.</p>

<p>"Okay," Vee started. "Just so I have this all clear in my head, there are four big umbrella for attraction, right. You have the heterosexual umbrella, so guys who only like girls and girls who only like guys. Alongside that is homosexual, gay for guys who like guys and lesbian for girls who like girls. Then there is the bisexual umbrella for people who like both, and then aroace for people who don't feel romantic or sexual attraction at all. Do I have that right?" Vee hoped she had that all down. Humans had a lot of different labels.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's a good way to think of it," Masha responded. "Of course, there are a lot of other orientations and sexualities, but those are the big four, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Nice. Okay, followup question: I also see the acronym LGBT floating around, and I can guess that L is for lesbian, G for gay, and B for bi, but what does that T stand for?"</p>

<p>"In this case, the T stands for transgender, or just trans for short. The quickest way I can explain it would be that a trans person believes that the gender they truly are doesn't match with the body they were born in. Most trans people will seek out ways to affirm their gender, like dressing a certain way, or they may even be prescribed hormones or go through surgery," Masha explained.</p>

<p>"Man, I guess I'm pretty lucky then," Vee said. "If I want to change how I look, I can just shapeshift and be done with it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll love you no matter what form you're in, <em>mein Schatz</em>." Masha wrapped their arm around Vee, pulling her into a hug.</p>

<p>"I love you too, <em>mi corazon</em>," Vee replied.</p>

<p>"So, you got any other burning questions you need answered?" Masha asked.</p>

<p>"Just one," Vee said. "What's a pride flag?"</p>

<p>"That one's pretty simple. A pride flag is basically a set of colors that someone can use to identify a specific gender identity or sexuality. So you could have a bi pride flag, like the one on Luz's little beanie pin, or you could have the rainbow flag, which is more of an overall LGTBQ flag, like the one your mom always wears."</p>

<p>"Is there a flag for nonbinary people?" Vee asked.</p>

<p>"Yup! It goes yellow, white, purple, black." Masha said that with a smile, showing off their nails that were painted in the color scheme.</p>

<p>Vee looked at the outstretched hand and gasped. "So that's what those colors mean!"</p></body></html>
