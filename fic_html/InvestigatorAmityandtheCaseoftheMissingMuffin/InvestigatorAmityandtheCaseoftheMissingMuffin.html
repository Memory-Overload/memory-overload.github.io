<html><head><title>Investigator Amity and the Case of the Missing Muffin</title></head><body><p>Amity was <em>pissed</em>. Somebody had stolen the muffin that she had been looking forward to eating all morning. It had been there not even five minutes prior, yet when she had returned from her morning teeth brushing, the muffin had vanished from its spot on the kitchen counter.</p>

<p>Summoning a trilby and a candy cigarette out of thin air, Amity knew what had to be done. It was time for Investigator Amity to make an appearance. After squaring the hat on her head, she summoned a small fireball on her finger and lit the candy cigarette. Taking a drag, she immediately started coughing.</p>

<p>Bad idea. Nope, never doing that again.</p>

<p>Extinguishing the flaming candy by pressing the stick against her jeans, Amity then tossed the burnt sugar into the trash can. (Hopefully Ms. Camila wouldn't mind.) Well, at least she looked good in the hat.</p>

<p>
  <em>No, come on, Blight. You have to focus!</em>
</p>

<p>As she stroked an imaginary beard, Amity began compiling a list of suspects in her mind.</p><hr />

<p>
  <strong>Suspect One: Hunter Whatever-His-Last-Name-Is</strong>
</p>

<p>Slamming her palms down on the kitchen table, Amity leaned in close to the Grimwalker, staring him right in the eye.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hunter," she started.</p>

<p>"Umm, hi?" Hunter responded, saying it more like a question than a greeting.</p>

<p>"Did you steal my muffin?" Amity asked, deciding to skip straight to the burning question.</p>

<p>Hunter paused for a second, caught off guard by the topic. "No. I didn't even know you had a muffin."</p>

<p>"How did you not know I was saving my pumpkin chocolate chip muffin for breakfast this morning?" Amity was bewildered by Hunter's statement.</p>

<p>"Because I don't care about your muffin? I don't even like muffins," Hunter answered.</p>

<p>"How do you not like muff- Okay, that doesn't matter," Amity stopped herself from going on a rant about how muffins were obviously the best choice for breakfast. "Do you have any idea who could have stolen my muffin?"</p>

<p>"No, because I was doing more important things than watching your muffin." Hunter replied.</p>

<p>"Like what?" Amity pressed the issue.</p>

<p>"Reading <em>Cosmic Frontier</em>, working on a sewing project, watching a documentary, literally anything else," he said, counting them on his finger.</p>

<p>Amity could see where he was coming from. "Fine, I'll give you that."</p>

<p>"So can I go, then?" Hunter asked. "I want to finish reading the new CF book."</p>

<p>"Yeah, whatever," Amity relented. "I'll just ask someone else if they know where my muffin went."</p><hr />

<p>
  <strong>Suspect Two: Luz Noceda</strong>
</p>

<p>"Ooh, are you going to interrogate me like you did with Hunter?" Luz asked as she took her seat at the table.</p>

<p>"What? No! This isn't an interrogation. This is just... me asking questions about what happened to my muffin." Amity explained. This was very clearly <em>not</em> an interrogation.</p>

<p>"Then why are the curtains drawn and the only light coming from this table lamp that's shining in my face?" Luz squinted and shielded her face from the annoyingly bright light.</p>

<p>"I like the ambiance," Amity supplied.</p>

<p>Luz scrunched her face up and laughed. "Sure, <em>batata</em>, sure. So, you mentioned a muffin."</p>

<p>"Oh, right," Amity. Doing her best mean mug, she got incredibly close to Luz and stood up on her tiptoes so she could be taller than the seated girl. As she "towered" over her girlfriend, Luz responded by booping her on the nose, causing Amity to involuntarily go cross-eyed.</p>

<p>"Hey, stop that! I'm trying to be intimidating." Amity batted Luz's hand away when she went for another boop.</p>

<p>Luz laughed. "Hehe, well it's not working."</p>

<p>Crossing her arms and taking a step back so she was out of booping range, Amity started the <strike>interrogation</strike> questions. "Do you have any idea what happened to my muffin?"</p>

<p>"Nope!" Luz responded, popping the "p". "What flavor is it?"</p>

<p>"Pumpkin chocolate chip," Amity answered. "Hey, wait a minute! I'm the one asking questions here."</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry, sorry," Luz apologized. "Go ahead. Next question."</p>

<p>"Any idea where my muffin could be?" Amity inquired.</p>

<p>"Hmm..." Luz pondered where she would hide a stolen muffin. "The fridge?"</p>

<p>Amity stared. "Really?"</p>

<p>Luz shrugged. "It's so obvious that you wouldn't check there."</p>

<p>Walking over to the fridge, Amity yanked the door open revealing that there was no muffin.</p>

<p>"Darn," Luz said as she peeked over her girlfriend's shoulder. "Whelp, I've got nothing then."</p>

<p>Letting out a sigh, Amity pointed to the living room. "Go, Luz. Be free."</p>

<p>"Okay!" Luz skipped off into the living room.</p><hr />

<p>
  <strong>Suspect Three: Willow Park</strong>
</p>

<p>"No, I did not steal your muffin. No, I don't have any idea who did. No, I don't know where it could be." Before Amity could open her mouth, Willow had already answered every question she was going to ask, and in order, too!</p>

<p><em>Rats! This is going to be harder than I expected,</em> Amity thought.</p>

<p>"Darn. Well, thanks anyway, Willow."</p><hr />

<p>Collapsing onto the couch, Amity let out a groan. None of her suspects were the thief, and none of them had any leads as to who the actual thief was. As she wallowed in her misery of never getting her beloved pastry back, Gus walked into the living room from the basement below, and in his left hand he carried Amity's pumpkin chocolate chip muffin.</p>

<p>Well, half of it. Based on the crumbs framing Gus' mouth, she could make an educated guess as to where the other half was. Noticing the dour look on his friend's face, Gus offered what remained of the muffin out to Amity. As the lavender-haired witch saw what was being held out, she slowly met eyes with the boy.</p>

<p>"Muffin?" Gus asked.</p>

<p>"Augustus," Amity replied.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"<em>Run.</em>"</p></body></html>
