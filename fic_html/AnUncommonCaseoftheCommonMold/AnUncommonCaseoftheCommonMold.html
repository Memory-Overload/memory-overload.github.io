  <title>An Uncommon Case of the Common Mold</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Vee was having a normal, pleasant day, relaxing in bed in her human form. That was, until she sneezed and her arm
    turned into that of a grizzly bear.</p>

  <p>If Vee was in her right state of mind, she would probably be thinking about how something like this had never
    happened to her before and how she most likely needed to ask the other basilisks if this had ever happened to them.
  </p>

  <p>But she wasn't.</p>

  <p><em>Woah, that's paw-some</em>, she thought, examining the altered appendage. She sluggishly clawed at the air and
    giggled.</p>

  <p>She sneezed again, and her arm was back to its normal form. However, an elephant's trunk was suddenly occupying the
    space her nose used to be.</p>

  <p><em>Ooh, I should to go find some peanuts. Then I can snort 'em and fire 'em at Mash. I'd be a peanut Gatling gun.
      Heh, that's funny.</em> She imagined Masha spinning her tail and Vee firing out volleys of peanuts at zombies as
    they tried to break into the couple's house.</p>

  <p>Another sneeze (a particularly loud one, thanks to her sudden Joseph Merrick impression), another uncontrolled
    morph. The trunk was gone, but now Vee had bat ears poking out of her hair. A wave of sound crashed into her new
    ears, causing her to cry out and do her best to block out the audio assault.</p>

  <p>"Vee?! Are you okay?!" Masha rushed into the room to find Vee covering her ears, curled into the fetal position.
    Then, though, Vee sneezed, and both of her legs suddenly sprouted fur and hooves.</p>

  <p>Vee laughed. "Hehe, I'm good." She looked down to see what the new change was. "Woah, I'm like a satyr now. Clip
    clop clip clop." She stamped her hooves against the mattress.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are <em>not</em> fine," Masha said. This had to be something Demon Realm specific. They didn't know of
    anything from the Human Realm that could make someone suddenly shapeshift against their will. Thus, Masha pulled out
    their phone and called Luz. On the third ring, Luz picked up.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Masha. What's up?" she answered cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"I know this is kinda sudden," they began, "but do you have any experience with Boiling Isles sicknesses?"</p>

  <p>Luz paused for a bit before responding. "Yeah, I guess so. What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Vee's been sneezing a lot, and every time she does so, she has a random part of her body shapeshift. I'm
    also pretty sure she's delirious."</p>

  <p>(Vee sneezed, and she now sported crab pincers for hands.)</p>

  <p>"Hmm..." Luz had a suspicion about what illness had befallen her adoptive sister, but she wanted to make sure. "Can
    you put Vee on for me? I want to talk to her."</p>

  <p>"Sure," Masha replied, and they promptly handed the phone over to the basilisk after putting it on speakerphone.
    Vee gingerly took the device in her claws.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Vee. It's Luz. How ya feeling?" The basilisk stared at the phone in her pincers.</p>

  <p>"Luz? How did you get in this tiny glowing box? Are you trapped? Don't worry, I'll save you!" Vee needed to rescue
    the girl from her miniature prison, so she raised her pincer, ready to strike the glowing box so that her sister
    could be freed from its evil confines.</p>

  <p>Masha yanked their phone back before it could get impaled. Turning off speakerphone, they held it back up to their
    ear.</p>

  <p>"Any ideas?" they asked. Hopefully whatever was wrong with Vee could get solved quickly through some healing magic
    or something similar.</p>

  <p>(Another sneeze. Vee now had the eyes of a housefly. "I can see <em>everything</em>.")</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty sure she's come down with the common mold," Luz answered.</p>

  <p>Masha sighed. "Of course it's called the common mold, because why wouldn't it be?"</p>

  <p>Luz's chuckle could be heard over the speaker. "Eh, don't worry. I've had it before, and it was pretty harmless. I
    just acted funky for about half a day and had some shrooms sprout from my head, but nothing long-lasting."</p>

  <p>"Well that's a relief," Masha said. "So is there a cure for the mold, or do we have to just wait it out?"</p>

  <p>"No cure exists, so you gotta wait it out," Luz explained.</p>

  <p>Masha breathed in sharply through gritted teeth. "Well that sucks to hear. In that case, do you have any advice for
    helping Vee get through this?"</p>

  <p>Luz thought for a second before responding. "You could always make her some chicken noodle soup. Good for the soul,
    and all that jazz."</p>

  <p>"Better than nothing, I suppose." Masha's Oma always touted that a good <em>Huhnersuppe</em> could cure any
    ailment, so they guessed it was time to put that to the test. Taking one last look at Vee, who now had an alligator
    tail poking between her legs, Masha blew her a kiss before heading downstairs to whip something up to make their
    <em>Schatz</em> feel better.</p>

  <p>Throwing open the pantry door, Masha searched the rows of foodstuffs, searching for the can of soup that they knew
    was in there. Was it behind the bag of tortilla chips? Nope. Mixed in with the butter and vegetable oil sprays? No
    luck. Finally, they pulled back a box of instant mac and cheese to reveal the lone can of chicken noodle soup.
    Jackpot.</p>

  <p>Grabbing the can, Masha checked it to see what the instructions said. <em>Stovetop: Pour your can of Bellcamp's
      Classic Chicken Noodle Soup</em> <em>into a medium pot</em> - Masha quit reading the instructions. That was
    probably going to take too long, and they wanted to be with Vee as much as possible, so they made a quick decision.
    Grabbing a bowl from the cabinet above them, they ripped the aluminum lid off the soup can and poured its contents
    into the bowl. Not all of it came out together, though, so Masha resorted to using a spoon to scoop free the last
    holdouts of the noodles that clung desperately to the sides of the can.</p>

  <p>(A sneeze could be heard from upstairs, and Masha couldn't help but wonder what new form Vee had taken.)</p>

  <p>Now with the can empty, they added a little bit of water to thin out the broth. Once the bowl was prepared to their
    liking, Masha placed the bowl in the microwave and set in on High for a minute and a half. Once the microwaved
    beeped that it was done, they took out the soup and tried to guesstimate how hot it was. Normally, they would have
    just thrown it in for another 30 seconds or so, but they didn't want to risk Vee burning her tongue on piping hot
    chicken broth.</p>

  <p>After putting a spoon in the bowl and placing the bowl on a small ceramic plate, Masha slowly carried the soup up
    the stairs and into their and Vee's bedroom. They knocked on the door, announcing their presence.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Vee. I got you some soup." They held up the plate, showing Vee the soup in all its chicken-y and noodle-y
    glory.</p>

  <p>Vee's newest form was apparently her human disguise with two additional eyeballs growing out of the top of her
    skull, swiveling around on little stalk-like appendages. "Whakindasoup?" she slurred out.</p>

  <p>"Chicken noodle." Masha replied, which drew a laugh from Vee for some reason.</p>

  <p>"Did a chicken cook the noodles?" the basilisk asked.</p>

  <p>It was Masha's turn to laugh. "I don't think so, silly."</p>

  <p>"I'm not silly! I'm Vee!" she corrected.</p>

  <p>Masha had to hold themselves back from groaning at the awful attempt at a joke. "Alright, funny gal, let's get some
    soup in you." With that, they finally handed the plate and bowl over to Vee, who looked in the bowl like there was
    some hidden message waiting to be unveiled.</p>

  <p>"Come on, try it. Tell me what you think," Masha said, trying to nudge the basilisk into eating.</p>

  <p>Vee cautiously dipped her spoon into the broth and withdrew a small amount. After inspecting it for a few seconds,
    she cautiously swallowed the bite.</p>

  <p>"Well, how is it?" Masha asked.</p>

  <p>"It good," Vee replied, already feeling better.</p>

  <p>Over the course of the next 15 minutes, Vee slowly emptied the bowl of its contents. Once it had been fully cleaned
    of every last scrap of chicken, Masha took the plate and set it on the bedside table.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired." Vee said quietly, letting out a small yawn.</p>

  <p>"Okay then, sleepyhead. Get some rest," Masha responded.</p>

  <p>They placed a small kiss on Vee's forehead before turning out the lights and shutting the door.</p>
