    <h1>Luz Peels Her Face Open Like A Banana</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Gehetag 2, Sixth Lunar Disappearance, 50 CE | The Den of the Bat Queen</strong>
    </p>

    <p>"Alright, Luz, are ya ready for your first molt?"</p>

    <p>Tre and Luz had left the main park-like area of the den, now standing in a secluded spot full of rocks and fallen
        trees. Eda and Ivy had similarly gone off to talk about... something, and King had tagged along with the Owl
        Lady so that manticore couldn't bother him anymore.</p>

    <p>"Do I have much of a choice?" Luz responded with a question of her own.</p>

    <p>"Eh, not really," Tre replied. "If it makes you feel any better, you're lucky we can do this now before the
        lubricant starts to dry up. I've had a few bad molts in my time, and they suck big time."</p>

    <p>Luz took a deep breath and exhaled. "Whelp, no time like the present, I guess. So, what's step one in basilisk
        molting? Whenever Reggie would shed, he would always start by rubbing his cute little snout against his favorite
        log."</p>

    <p>Tre looked puzzled at the name. "Who is Reggie?"</p>

    <p>"My adorable pet python back home in the Human Realm. He's only the cutest baby green tree python in the whole
        wide world," Luz answered.</p>

    <p>"Yeah, well we're not doing this the Reggie way," Tre said.</p>

    <p>"What? Why not?" Luz asked.</p>

    <p>"Think about it. Do you want to spend 10 minutes rubbing your head against a log hoping to open up a large enough
        hole that you can start shimmying out of?" Tre asked, rubbing his hand across his cheek, mimicking the action he
        described.</p>

    <p>"Not really, no," Luz responded, shaking her head.</p>

    <p>Tre slithered over to one of the nearby fallen trees and reached his hand inside a large hole that had been
        carved. He withdrew a small fabric bag, and then from that bag he pulled out an incredibly sharp looking
        wood-carving knife. He made his way back over to Luz before holding out the blade.</p>

    <p>"That's why we have this bad boy." Tre handed the knife to Luz.</p>

    <p>"Woah," was all Luz could respond with as she received the knife. She turned it over in her hand, examining it.
        The handle of the knife had a smooth finish, and it was engraved with the initials CW. The blade itself seemed
        to be made of steel or something similar. Ever so gently poking the blade into her finger, the sensation Luz
        felt was odd. It was like she could feel the blade pressing against her fingertip, but it was a dull pressure,
        like she was wearing those special gloves from woodshop or something.</p>

    <p>"When it comes time for Ivy or I to shed, we use this to jumpstart the process," Tre explained. "It lets us make
        sure that we get a clean separation between the skin we're shedding and the new one underneath. It ain't the
        prettiest, but it works." He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

    <p>"So, I just take this and cut a slit in my face? And then I, what, peel it open like a banana, or something?" Luz
        wasn't exactly sure if this was the safest way. This felt like something out of horror movie from the 70s.</p>

    <p>"No idea what a banana is, but sure let's go with that," Tre said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Titan, my life has taken a turn for the bizarre. If Mama saw me right now, she'd probably have a conniption."
        Luz steadied the knife in her claws. She just had to make one small little cut that would only pierce the dead
        layer of skin that was hanging off her body. Nice and easy. She could totally do this.</p>

    <p>"Nope! I can't do this!" Luz held the knife out as far from her as possible.</p>

    <p>Tre gently took the handle from her outstretched hand. "And that is totally fine. When I first shed using this
        method, I nearly took my eye out with how much my hand was shaking. Do you want me to make the incision for
        you?"</p>

    <p>Luz gulped. "Yes, please." She could do this. She could totally do this. It was just like going to the doctor to
        get a shot. Except this was a person she had just met an hour ago slicing her face open, not poking her in the
        arm with a needle.</p>

    <p>Luz took another deep breath. "Alright, I'm ready. Let's do it."</p>

    <p>"Good to hear," Tre said, slithering forward to close the gap between the two. "Now, fair warning: this is
        probably going to feel pretty weird since this is your first time. Just know that if everything goes smoothly,
        then you shouldn't feel any pain whatsoever, maybe a little pressure at the most. Are you positive and 100% sure
        that you are ready?"</p>

    <p>Luz nodded.</p>

    <p>"Alright. If it will make this any easier, you can close your eyes so you don't see the blade. That helped me
        through my first few sheds," Tre said in a calm voice.</p>

    <p>"Okay, I can do that," Luz said, shutting her eyes. She did her best to remain completely still, but her left
        hand betrayed her by fidgeting, her claws tapping against the dead skin she was soon to be rid of.</p>

    <p>"Remember, this should only feel like a little pressure," Luz heard Tre say. "I'm going to start the incision in
        3... 2... 1..."</p>

    <p>The blade made contact with Luz's forehead, being pushed in the slightest bit. <em>Oh, Titan this feels weird.
        </em>Tre was true to his word, though, as Luz wasn't in any pain. The closest thing she could compare it to was
        someone pushing their finger lightly against her forehead.</p>

    <p>Tre slowly moved the knife down until it reached Luz's nose, lengthening the cut. He adjusted the blade before
        continuing the incision, being especially careful to not give Luz a sudden nose piercing. Then, he was even more
        delicate around Luz's mouth, barely putting any pressure behind the cut as the blade grazed against her lips.
        Finally, Tre maneuvered the blade down Luz's chin before pulling back to admire his handiwork.</p>

    <p>"And we are done. I'd have to say that was some of my finest work. How was it?" Luz slowly opened her eyes to see
        Tre smiling, casually tossing the knife into the air and catching it by the handle.</p>

    <p>"You were right," Luz said. "That was definitely... an experience. I thought it was gonna be worse, honestly."
        She felt around her face, able to clearly tell where the knife had been.</p>

    <p>"Well, congrats on making it through step one," Tre replied. "However, that was the easy part."</p>

    <p>Luz groaned. "Oh Titan, that was the <em>easy</em> part? What's next?" She then thought about what she'd seen
        Reggie do, and she groaned even louder. "Don't tell me..."</p>

    <p>Tre laughed. "Yup, this next part is more embarrassing than challenging or painful."</p>

    <p>Luz sighed. "Yeah, well I've been embarrassed enough already at Gravesfield High. What's the most, I dunno,
        dignified way to do this stage of the process?"</p>

    <p>Tre exhaled sharply. "There isn't really a 'dignified' way to shed. If it helps you feel better, know that Ivy
        and I have both accepted we look silly doing it. That allows us to just laugh about it after the fact. Titan,
        I'm pretty sure Ivy recorded me during a particularly bad molt and has it listed under 'Blackmail' on her
        scroll."</p>

    <p>"At least that means I won't be alone in feeling stupid," Luz said, letting out a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"The sooner you accept it looks stupid, the better, honestly," Tre added.</p>

    <p>The two stood in silence for a few seconds before Luz spoke up. "Alright, let's just get this over with. What do
        I have to do to finish molting?"</p>

    <p>Tre pointed at a set of extremely long logs placed parallel to each other, laying about three feet apart. "See
        those logs over there? That's what we use to finish the process. All you gotta do is get down on your belly and
        slither between those two extremely slowly. If all goes well, your molt should catch on to the logs and come
        right off. You might have to make a couple passes, though, as sometimes your shed might not feel like coming off
        in one piece."</p>

    <p>Luz was somewhat surprised. "Really, that's all I have to do?"</p>

    <p>Tre shrugged. "Pretty much, yeah. Molting isn't as scary as it first may seem."</p>

    <p>The duo slithered over to the pair of logs, and Luz examined the setup. She could probably fit though that with
        room to spare.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure that will be squeeze-y enough?" Luz asked.</p>

    <p>Tre tapped a claw on his chin. "You are a bit smaller than us. Good thing we can just do this." Tre grabbed one
        of the logs and rolled it over, moving it closer to the other.</p>

    <p>"Think that'll work better?" he asked.</p>

    <p>Luz did her best to imagine herself slithering through the gap. "Probably? I dunno, you're the expert here."</p>

    <p>"I guess the only way to know is to just go for it," Tre supplied.</p>

    <p>Luz positioned herself in front of the two logs. She then went prone, laying on her belly and giving her the
        appearance of an oddly proportioned snake. Her hands stuck out in front of her, like she was trying to swim on
        land.</p>

    <p>"So I go through like this?" she asked, turning her head to face Tre.</p>

    <p>"Close, but you'll actually want to tuck your arms to your side like this, not have them stick out." Tre pinned
        his arms to his side to show Luz how it should look. "You want your head to go through first so the molt can
        start sliding off and then everything else will follow after. Does that make sense?"</p>

    <p>"Ahh, okay. I get it." Luz copied the other basilisk's stance. "Like this?"</p>

    <p>"Yup. Now just start slithering through the gap <em>really</em> slowly," Tre instructed.</p>

    <p>Luz nodded, and began slowly inching her way between the logs. As her face brushed against the logs, she didn't
        feel anything at first. However, as she moved further down the tunnel, she felt what could only be described as
        having her skin slowly detach from the rest of her body.</p>

    <p>It was like that classic trick she would do back in elementary school. She would get one of those glue bottles
        and splurt it out all over hand hand and spread it around. Then, when the glue dried, she would pick at it until
        it came off and then she would show her glue skin to the other kids. That was one of Luz's favorites! (Mrs.
        Brandy didn't like that, though.)</p>

    <p>This time around, though, it was her actual skin that was being peeled off. Thank the Titan it didn't hurt.
        Nevertheless, Luz soldiered on, slowly slithering forward, with more and more dead skin pooling up on her back.
    </p>

    <p>After a few minutes of slow progress, Luz noticed that the skin around her eyes was starting to move. As she
        slithered forward, the molt continued to peel back, giving Luz a firsthand experience of going from shoddy, not
        very good, and annoyingly cloudy vision, back to her normal vision as the skin peeled away. (Maybe that
        lubricant Tre had mentioned caused the cloudiness? Luz wasn't exactly sure, as basilisk biology was really
        weird. She made a mental note to ask Tre or Ivy about that later.) She blinked a few times as her vision slowly
        restored. She didn't realize how bright and vibrant the trees were this deep into the forest! The auburn leaves
        stood in stark contrast to the brown wood, with small flowers peeking through the foliage to spruce up the
        scenery. Luz nearly let out an audible gasp at how pretty it all was.</p>

    <p>But now wasn't the time to stop and smell the roses, she had a mission to do, and she had some skin to shed!</p>

    <p>Refocusing herself, Luz resumed slowly making her way down the log tunnel. More and more of her old skin
        gathering behind her as she gradually escaped its confines. From what she could see, Luz guessed she was about
        halfway done, and there looked to be plenty of log tunnel left to go to help her out.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>With one last wriggle, Luz was free. Slithering forward a few more feet, she then turned around. There,
        sandwiched between two logs in the middle of a forest, lay Luz's first shed.</p>

    <p>"So," Tre broke the silence, "how do you feel now that you've gone through your first molt?"</p>

    <p>Luz took a deep breath and slowly exhaled before answering. "I feel like a whole new person." She then chuckled
        as she looked at her own dead skin, laying there haphazardly bunched together on the dirt, still all in one
        piece. She gently scooped it up and cradled it in her arms.</p>

    <p>"Look, Mom. I finally shed my pajamas."</p>
