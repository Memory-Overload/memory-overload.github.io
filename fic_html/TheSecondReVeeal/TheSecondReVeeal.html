<html><head><title>The Second Re-Vee-al</title></head><body><p>Vee paced back and forth in the living room of the Noceda house. She was pretty sure that if she kept it going, she would start leaving tread marks in the carpet, but she was too nervous to care. She was finally going to do it. Ax and Marco would finally get an explanation as to why "Luz" suddenly stopped hanging out with them and then gained a new sibling out of nowhere. Feeling her tail curl around her leg, Vee let out a groan. How was she even going to start the conversation?</p>

<p>"<em>Hey, guys. So, you know how you met 'Luz' at Reality Check Camp? Well, that was actually me, because I'm a shapeshifting demon from another dimension and the real Luz was off learning how to be a witch from a wanted criminal and rebelling against a tyrannical, genocidal Puritan from the 1600s.</em>"</p>

<p>That wouldn't go down well.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I can do this," Vee complained, collapsing onto the couch and laying her head on Masha's thighs.</p>

<p>"<em>Sei ruhig, meine Schlange</em>," Masha said, stroking Vee's hair to calm her down. "You're gonna do great, and I'll be right here if you need me."</p>

<p>Vee craned her neck and flicked her tongue out, elongating it so that she could boop Masha on the nose, drawing a laugh from the enby. "Thanks, Mash."</p>

<p>A knock at the door signaled that the rest of Cabin Seven had arrived. Quickly shifting fully into her Luz disguise, Vee got to her feet and gave her clothes a once over. (Sure, she had just shapeshifted them into existence, but wrinkles were still an annoyance.) It felt odd, donning this disguise once again. She hadn't used it since the day she met the real Luz and revealed what she really was to Camila. Looking to Masha for last-minute encouragement, they gave her a thumbs up and a smile.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath and slowly exhaling, Vee opened the front door to greet Ax and Marco. "Hey, guys. Come on in." Slowly entering the house, Ax looked it up and down, jamming his hands in his pockets as he made his way into the living room. Marco was quick to follow, but he actually acknowledged "Luz" with a quiet "Yo," before joining Ax and Masha on the couch.</p>

<p>Once everyone was inside, Vee closed the front door, locked it, and flipped the deadbolt before dropping the shutters on the living room window and pulling the cord so that no light could enter the room. Flicking on the overhead light, Vee walked to stand in front of Ax and Marco.</p>

<p>Taking another deep breath, Vee readied herself. It was now or never. "Alright, I know this is going to sound crazy, but -"</p>

<p>Marco's hand shot up like he was in class and had to ask a question.</p>

<p>"Yes, Marco?" Vee deadpanned.</p>

<p>"Did you call us here to interrogate us or something?" the Latino asked.</p>

<p>"What? No! Why - why would you think that?" Vee sputtered out, caught off guard by the topic of the question.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he responded. "Maybe because you just locked us in the house and made it so that nobody can see inside."</p>

<p>"I didn't lock you guys in the house, I locked everyone else out of the house," Vee explained.</p>

<p>"You forgot the kitchen door," Masha said, jerking their thumb to point out towards to the backyard.</p>

<p>"Dang it, I knew I forgot something!" Vee complained. "Can you get that, Mash? I don't want Jacob breaking in."</p>

<p>"On it," Masha replied, already halfway to the door.</p>

<p>Now it was Ax's turn to ask a question. "Wait, who's Jacob, and what's with all the secrecy?"</p>

<p>Vee pointed her index finger at the boy, "Hold that thought, because we'll get to it eventually."</p>

<p>After waiting for Masha to return to their seat, Vee was finally ready to begin explaining herself, but she needed one more person to be present for it all to make sense. "Alright, Luz, you can come on down!" she shouted.</p>

<p>"Are they ready?" a voice responded loudly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, we're good," Vee replied.</p>

<p>Down the stairs trotted Luz Noceda. The <em>real</em> Luz Noceda. Sauntering over to stand by her sister's side, she draped an arm over Vee's shoulder and gave a two-finger salute with her free hand.</p>

<p>"Hey," she greeted the two shocked boys, whose eyes were flitting back and forth between the two Luzs who stood before them.</p>

<p>Ax took his glasses off, cleaned them, and put them back on before blinking rapidly. Okay, he wasn't just imagining things, then. There really was two of Luz Noceda. Marco was similarly in shock, his mouth hanging open.</p>

<p>"Wait... but..." Marco stuttered.</p>

<p>Luz stepped forward and offered out her hand. "Nice to meet you. I'm Luz Noceda. The real one."</p>

<p>Marco cautiously shook her hand. After Luz resumed her spot, he looked over to Vee. "Wait, so If she's Luz, then who are you? Luz Prime, or something?"</p>

<p>Vee laughed at the comment. "No, but I can see the confusion. My name's Vee. Vee Noceda. I'm the person you went to Reality Check with. Luz here was... preoccupied, so I took her place."</p>

<p>"So, you two are, what, twins?" Ax was pretty confused by what exactly was going on. Luz, no, <em>Vee</em> had never mentioned having a twin when they were at camp, but he guessed that kind of made sense if they were Parent Trapping the camp.</p>

<p>"Nah, I'm adopted," Vee replied.</p>

<p>"Aren't you dating a person called Vee, Masha?" Marco asked, recalling Masha talking about going on a date with a person who went by that name.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's her." Masha responded, blowing a kiss Vee's way, who blushed at the gesture.</p>

<p>"Aww, thanks Mash. But, yeah, I was the one you guys went to camp with," Vee explained. "Super helpful, by the way. I basically knew nothing about the whole 'being a human' thing, so the classes were greatly appreciated."</p>

<p>"Hold on. Are you... not human?" Marco asked, confused by what Vee was implying. She looked pretty human to him.</p>

<p>"Nope, I'm actually a demon, from the Demon Realm." Dropping her disguise, Vee reverted back to her true form.</p>

<p>"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!" Marco scrambled backwards, over the top of the couch, and fell hard to the floor with an <em>OOF</em>.</p>

<p>"What the fuuu..." Ax trailed off, staring at Vee.</p>

<p>"Ahh, this feels better," Vee said, doing a little shimmy.</p>

<p>Marco popped up from behind the couch. "I'm not imagining things, right?"</p>

<p>"Nope! This is the real me," Vee said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Do you want to explain, or should I?" Luz asked her sister.</p>

<p>"I'll take it," the basilisk replied after contemplating how off-track Luz would probably go. Nodding in acknowledgement, Luz stepped back, giving Vee the floor.</p>

<p>"Alright, Ax. What do you know demons?" Vee asked.</p>

<p>"Uhm... they come from hell," he responded, though he sounded unsure of his answer.</p>

<p>"And you're already 0 for 1," Vee said.</p>

<p>"They <em>don't</em> come from hell?" Ax replied after a brief pause.</p>

<p>"They come from the <em>Demon Realm</em>," Vee emphasized the last part. "Not Hell. That doesn't exist. At least, I don't think."</p>

<p>"So, you're from the Demon Realm, which is different from Hell, which may or may not exist?" Marco asked, taking his spot back on the couch.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Vee replied. "Though Earth is way better in my opinion. I don't have to worry about being hunted by a tyrannical government or everyone running away in fear whenever I get close."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure if this is, like, demon-ist or something," Ax said, "but what kind of demon are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm a basilisk," Vee answered. "Only one of five alive, so I'm technically an endangered species!"</p>

<p>"Wait, aren't basilisks supposed to kill you if you look at them?" Ax had done his fair share of studying numerous mythologies, and basilisk were one of the most dangerous mythical creatures from what he read.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well humans are just wrong about that. We can drain magic from witches and other demons, though, so I can kinda see where they can get that from," Vee answered.</p>

<p>"Wait, witches? We talking <em>Cynthia Coven</em> witches with wands and stuff?" The bespectacled boy had always dreamed of being a wizard.</p>

<p>"More like pointy ears and spell circles," Luz corrected. "I'm actually dating one, see!" Pulling out her phone, she opened up an image of her and Amity together on a date in Bonesborough cafe.</p>

<p>"Woah, that definitely isn't Earth," Marco said. Then he put two and two together. "Wait, so when Vee was at Reality Check, you were in the Demon Realm?"</p>

<p>"Yuh huh, you're looking at the very first Human Witch," Luz responded proudly. "I even discovered an ancient spellcasting technique using glyphs. But they don't work here, which kinda sucks. Though, I did get to, you know, save the entire planet from genocide."</p>

<p>"Hold up, what?" Ax was taken aback. Who would want to genocide an entire realm? Was there a demon Hitler that he had to worry about?</p>

<p>"Yeah. This super big meanie named Belos wanted to kill everyone," Luz explained. "Not cool, obviously, so he had to be... dealt with permanently. Oh, and he's also Phillip Wittebane, as it turns out."</p>

<p>"Wait, Phillip Wittebane, as in 'statue in the middle of town Phillip Wittebane'?" Marco asked, recognizing the name from the history lessons he only somewhat paid attention to.</p>

<p>"The one and only. He's a stain on the ground, now, though, so we don't have to worry about him ever again." Luz smiled at the memory of Eda, Raine, and King stomping him out of existence.</p>

<p>Marco exhaled slowly. "Dang, I knew people from the 1600s were racist and stuff, but he took that to whole nother level. A demon must have pissed in his cornflakes something fierce for him to try and kill all of them."</p>

<p>Masha laughed at Marco's description. "That's certainly a way to think of it."</p>

<p>Ax suddenly stood up and rubbed his forehead. "Alright, let me make sure I understand everything." He pointed at Luz. "You went to the Demon Realm, where Vee is from, and became a witch and murdered a dictator because he tried to kill everyone." He turned to Vee. "And all the while, you were posing as Luz at Reality Check camp and learning how to be human at the same time because you're actually a shapeshifting demon from Not-Hell wanting to escape being hunted."</p>

<p>"Pretty much." Vee responded.</p>

<p>"Well hot damn, my life looks like a cake walk in comparison," Ax said, placing his hands on his hips.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Earth is way nicer," Vee said. "Well, I'm getting pretty hungry. Wanna go get some tacos and then spray paint the statue of Phillip What-a-douche?"</p>

<p>"Do you even need to ask? Let's do it," Ax replied.</p></body></html>
