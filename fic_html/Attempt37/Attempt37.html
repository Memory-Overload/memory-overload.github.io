<p>I waited a few seconds. A muffled noise forced its way through the dirt. This one was a screamer. Of course it was.</p>

<p>It was quite shocking how easy it is to create life. Palistrom wood, selkidomus scales, stonesleeper lungs, a small galdorstone, and a bone. Five ingredients. That was all that was needed. Is this what the Good Lord felt like when he shaped a lump of clay into man, breathed life into it, and named it Adam? Perhaps. But I am not God, for I am just one of his servants.</p>

<p>Grabbing my shovel, I quickly moved aside the soil and charred remnants of plant life that trapped my creation. As the body slowly revealed itself, I took stock of how this attempt turned out physically. The mental acuity would have to be determined later.</p>

<p>I first removed the dirt covering 37's face. As I did so, a near imperceptible sound began. It was the sound of voices.</p>

<p>37's skin was a pale white color, not yet exposed to the light of the sun that would surely darken it in time. Its nose was aquiline and slightly crooked, looking more akin to a veteran boxer than a body that had just finished forming. That would have to be worked on in the next attempt. Its hair was matted and knotted up with twigs and small branches, but the dirty blond colouration was still visible. The colour was just the slightest bit off. Curses.</p>

<p>I dropped an ear towards its mouth and listened. Slow, shallow breaths. Well, at least it survived the formation process.</p>

<p>I continued inspecting 37. Its jawline was rounded with sunken cheeks. Lifting an eyelid revealed an inhuman red iris on a backdrop of chalk-white sclera. A regretful mark of this damnation-worthy method of creation. 37's eye flitted back and forth without order, indicating it was still deep in REM sleep. Its ears were misshapen, coming to much too sharp of a point, missing the natural round curves it should have had.</p>

<p>Switching course, I checked its mouth. Pulling back its thin, frail lips gave way to the teeth. They were blemish-free, save for an ugly gap between the two top incisors. Another error that will have to be taken care of. I wrenched open 37's jaw and inspected its tongue and gums, both of which turned out to be in pristine condition. Something had finally gone right.</p>

<p>I paused briefly. The bone of ortet that I had used for this attempt was one of the ribs. It had been taken from the corpse of that traitor that called himself my brother.</p>

<p>Oh, Caleb. If only you had not fallen for that wicked temptress. If only I could have - NO! It was <em>your </em>fault this all happened! I had warned you, Caleb. I had warned you that those creatures weren't to be trusted. Yet, you forced my hand. You stabbed me in the back when you tried to sire a child with one of those monsters. I only did what had to be done to save your soul, and now I am giving you another chance.</p>

<p>I shook my head. Those voices remained everpresent, and their whispers haunted me to no end.</p>

<p>Striking the dirt once more, I uncovered 37's arms and torso, the voices still eating at the back of my mind, though they were now louder than before.</p>

<p>Its shoulders were square, which was a promising start. The muscles were smooth and well-defined, much different from Attempt 36, which had barely made it out of the dirt before it collapsed to the ground and lay motionless. The veins that snaked their way down 37's arms were varicose. Interesting. I carefully inspected both hands, making sure that every finger was flexible and that all the joints functioned properly. As a welcome surprise, all of them worked as intended.</p>

<p>Now, for the most important test. I once again pressed my ear against 37's body, this time positioning it so I could clearly hear its "heart". I listened for the signature faint humming sound of the galdorstone that powered the whole body. Ahh, there it was. Good.</p>

<p>Finally, I uncovered 37's legs. As I did so, the voices grew even louder, pounding against my skull. Like they were being lead by the beat of a drum, the cacophony of voices had merged into one. "STOP!" They screamed. I did not listen.</p>

<p>Its body now free, I dragged it out of the hole in the Earth that had been its home for the last month. I propped its body up against the wall of the cave, keeping it in a seated position.</p>

<p>As I took a step back, 37's eyes fluttered open, letting out a groan.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hunter." I offered my hand to 37.</p>

<p>The voices stop, except for one. One voice that I knew far too well. The voice of my brother.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p></body></html>
