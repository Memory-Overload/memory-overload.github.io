<p>As 3:00 rolled around, Vee pulled up to the Pitt residence. She was disguised as Camila, of course. Cops probably wouldn't find it funny if they saw a 15 year-old girl without a license and no form of identification whatsoever driving around in a seemingly stolen car. As she got out of the car, she swiftly transformed into her regular human form. It still felt a little weird as she shrunk and everything around her seemed to grow a tiny bit taller.</p>

<p>Now in a much more comfortable form, Vee walked up the the driveway and went to go ring the doorbell. Before she could even reach her arm out to press the button, though, Masha was already there opening the door.</p>

<p>"Hey, Vee! Come on in," they said, beckoning Vee close with their free arm.</p>

<p>As the two entered the house proper, Masha held out their arm to stop Vee.</p>

<p>"Can you take your shoes off? Oma doesn't like it when people track mud into the house."</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure." Vee obliged, slipping her sneakers off after untying them.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Masha said, before turning around and cupping their hands around their mouth, forming a makeshift megaphone. "<em>Opa, Oma, Vee ist da! Wir gehen zum GHS, und Ich bin in zwei Stunden zuruck.</em>" [Grandpa, Grandma, Vee is here! We're going to the GHS, and I'll be back in two hours.]</p>

<p>"Woah, what language is that?" Vee asked. She had never heard anything quite like it.</p>

<p>"It's German. I've got to speak it here because Opa's English is... rusty at best," Masha explained.</p>

<p>"Could you teach me some?" If Vee was going to be coming here regularly, she didn't want to be completely in the dark about what Masha and their grandparents were saying.</p>

<p>"I dunno," Masha said with a smirk. "Will you teach me Spanish?"</p>

<p>"Definitely!" Vee replied, perhaps a bit too eagerly.</p>

<p>"Then it's a deal," the enby confirmed.</p>

<p>"<em>Hallo, Vee! Masha hat mir so viel von dir erzahlt.</em>" [Hello, Vee! Masha has told me so much about you.]</p>

<p>The two turned to see a portly man slowly making his way down the stairs. He wore a button-down shirt that was tucked into a pair of faded and torn blue-jeans. The few wisps of graying hair that the man still had clung desperately to his head.</p>

<p>"<em>Sie sagten, Sie beide hatten ein Date. Ist das richtig?</em>" [They said the two of you are going on a date. Is that right?]</p>

<p>Masha blushed intensely. "<em>Es ist kein Date, Opa! Es ist nur eine Tour.</em>" [It's not a date, Grandpa! It's just a tour.]</p>

<p>"<em>Ja, sicher,</em>" [Yeah, sure.] the grandftaher said with a chuckle. The man then seemed to remember something before turning to Vee.</p>

<p>"<em>Wo sind meine Manieren? Hallo, ich bin David, Masha's Grossvater.</em>" [Where are my manners? Hello, I'm David, Masha's grandfather.] The elderly man stuck out his hand.</p>

<p>Not understanding any of what was just said, except for maybe the man's name, Vee just shook his hand and said, "Hi."</p>

<p>"<em>Opa, Vee spricht kein Deutsch,</em>" [Grandpa, Vee can't speak German.] Masha explained.</p>

<p>"<em>Oh, entschuldigung. Ich wusste es nicht,</em>" [Oh, sorry. I didn't know.] David replied.</p>

<p>"<em>Konnen wir gehen? Es gibt viele Dinge, die ich Vee zeigen mochte,</em>" [Can we go? There's a lot of things I want to show to Vee.] Masha said impatiently.</p>

<p>David laughed again, a fully-bellied one that filled the room. "<em>Ja, naturlich. Los, los. Spass haben.</em>" [Yes, of course. Go, go. Have fun.] He waved them off with a hand.</p>

<p>"Come on, Vee. We're heading out."</p>

<p>"Wait, already?"</p>

<p>"Yup! Grab your shoes, 'cause it's tour time!"</p><hr />

<p>Vee and Masha sat down in a booth at the Robin's Roast Cafe. Before Vee sat a pastry called... something in French. She just picked it because it looked absolutely delicious. Opposite her, Masha took small sips from a latte.</p>

<p>"So when are we actually going to start the tour?" Vee asked.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? We're on the tour right now," Masha replied.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Vee was confused.</p>

<p>"The tour is going to be about all the fun things you can do in Gravesfield. What, did you think this was just going to me telling you scary stories about dead white guys or something?" Masha said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Kinda." Vee blushed and shrunk into her sweater a little bit, trying to hide her embarrassment.</p>

<p>Masha laughed even harder at Vee going into turtle mode, nearly causing them to spill their drink.</p>

<p>"Alright, so where do you want to head next? We can do either the county zoo or the mall across town, but we don't have time for both."</p>

<p>Vee exited turtle mode and contemplated for a second before answering.</p><hr />

<p>The pair walked side-by-side as they explored the zoo. The chilly Gravesfield air was unrelenting, so the two staid close to keep warm.</p>

<p>They had just gotten out of the reptile exhibit.</p>

<p>Vee thought that Masha had had a little too much fun in that exhibit, though. Every time they saw a snake they called Vee over and asked if the snake was secretly one of Vee's family members. Every time, Vee would have to say something along the lines of, "No, that is just a regular snake, Mash. I would know if it was a basilisk."</p>

<p>As the two exited the exhibit (and promptly got flash-banged by the sun after being in the dark for so long), Masha was planning their next move.</p>

<p>"Any patricular place you wanna look after this? There's the butterfly sanctuary, the aquarium, stuff like that." Masha asked, gauging Vee's interest as they listed the options.</p>

<p>"I want to see the giraffes," Vee said, putting on a bold front.</p>

<p>"The giraffes? Why them?" Masha was confused. Alligators were so much cooler than giraffes.</p>

<p>"Because I want to see one in person. I want to see how they're faring outside the Demon Realm," Vee explained.</p>

<p>"Wait, giraffes are demons?" Masha looked flabbergasted.</p>

<p>"Yeah. They were feared even more than us basilisks, so everyone banded together to banish them here."</p>

<p>Giraffes were now Masha's favorite animal and second favorite demon.</p>

<p>"That's super metal," was all Masha could respond with.</p>

<p>"So do you wanna go check out the giraffes?" Vee asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, please." Masha had to see the fearsome beasts up close.</p><hr />

<p>Zargothrax, Devourer of Souls, slowly chewed on the green food the fleshy two-leggers had offered it. It missed devouring the souls of witchlings. Back before it had been banished to this realm devoid of magic, Zargothrax, Devourer of Souls, was feared across the entire Boiling Isles as the most dangerous giraffe to ever walk the bones of the Titan.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a scent tickled its nostrils. A scent that it had nearly forgotten to the ravages of time. The smell of a demon. Zargothrax, Devourer of Souls, turned to the source of the scent.</p>

<p>A two-legger and a demon disguised as a two-legger stood next to each other, staring at Zargothrax, Devourer of Souls. The real two-legger pointed at the giraffe and said something in their strange dialect. The demon, on the other hoof, simply stared at Zargothrax, Devourer of Souls, an angry look on her face.</p>

<p><strong><em>BEGONE, PUNY DEMON</em></strong>, the giraffe said in the Old Tongue.</p>

<p><strong><em>NO U</em></strong>, the tiny demon replied, pulling out a small red card from her pocket and holding it up.</p>

<p>Zargothrax, Devourer of Souls, exploded.</p><hr />

<p>"That was just a tour, right?" Vee asked as the two walked up the driveway to the Noceda house. They had both received year-long bans from the zoo after the giraffe exploded. They had both tried to plead their innocence, but the security guard refused to hear them.</p>

<p>"Yeah, totally," Masha replied. "I mean, unless you want to act like this wasn't a tour. I'm totally fine with that."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be against that," Vee said.</p>

<p>"That's cool. Well, uh, good night, Vee!"</p>

<p>"Night, Masha."</p><hr /><div class="phone">
